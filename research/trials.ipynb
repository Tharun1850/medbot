It is \\neasier to recall information based on a real person than a page in a textbook. Another impor-\\ntant element in the retention of information is the depth of learning. Learning that seeks \\nto understand problems is more likely to be accessible later than superficial factual accu -\\nmulation. This is the basis of problem-based learning, whereby students explore problems \\nwith the help of a facilitator. The cases in this book are designed to provide another useful \\napproach, parallel to seeing patients and giving an opportunity for self-directed explora -\\ntion of clinical problems. They are based on the findings of history taking and examination, \\ntogether with the need to evaluate initial investigations such as blood investigations, X-rays \\nand electrocardiograms.\\nThese cases are no substitute for clinical experience with real patients, but they provide a safe \\nenvironment for students to explore clinical problems and their own approach to diagnosis \\nand management. Most are common problems that might present to a general practitioner’s \\nsurgery, a medical outpatients clinic or a session on call in hospital. There are a few more \\nunusual cases to illustrate specific points and to emphasize that rare things do present, even if \\nthey are uncommon. The cases are written to try to interest students in clinical problems and \\nto enthuse them to find out more. They try to explore thinking about diagnosis and manage -\\nment of real clinical situations.\\nThe first 20 cases are arranged by systems, but the next 80 are in random order since, in \\nmedicine, symptoms such as breathlessness and pain may relate to many different clini -\\ncal problems in various systems. We hope you enjoy working through the problems pre -\\nsented here and can put the lessons you learn into practice in your student days and \\nsubsequent career.\\nP John Rees\\nJames Pattison\\nGwyn Williams'),\n",

He still feels unwell \\nwhen he is seen 30  min after the onset. He was well until 6 months ago and then started \\nhaving falls. On some occasions the falls have been associated with loss of consciousness, \\nalthough he is unsure of the length of time he was unconscious. On other occasions he has \\nfelt dizzy and has had to sit down, but has not lost consciousness. These episodes usually hap-\\npened on exertion, but once or twice they have occurred while sitting down. He recovers over \\n10–15\\n min after each episode.\\nHe lives alone, and most of the episodes have not been witnessed. Once his granddaughter was \\nwith him when he blacked out. Worried, she called an ambulance. He looked so pale and still that \\nshe thought that he had died. He was taken to hospital, by which time he had recovered completely \\nand was discharged and told that he had a normal electrocardiogram (ECG) and chest X-ray.\\nThere is no history of chest pain or palpitations. He has had gout and some urinary frequency. \\nA diagnosis of benign prostatic hypertrophy has been made, for which he is on no treatment. \\nHe takes ibuprofen occasionally for the gout. He stopped smoking 5 years ago. He drinks \\n5–10 units of alcohol weekly. The dizziness and blackouts have not been associated with alco-\\nhol. There is no relevant family history. He used to work as an electrician.\\nExamination\\nHe is pale with a blood pressure of 96/64  mmHg. The pulse rate is 33/min, regular. There are \\nno heart murmurs. The jugular venous pressure is raised 3  cm with occasional rises. There is \\nno leg oedema; the peripheral pulses are palpable except for the left dorsalis pedis.

They have been a mixture \\nof dizziness and loss of consciousness. The one witnessed episode seems to have been asso -\\nciated with loss of colour. This suggests a loss of cardiac output usually associated with an \\narrhythmia. This may be the case despite the absence of any other cardiac symptoms. There \\nmay be an obvious flushing of the skin as cardiac output and blood flow return.\\nThe normal ECG and chest X-ray when he attended hospital after an episode do not rule out \\nan intermittent conduction problem. On this occasion the symptoms have remained in a \\nmore minor form. The ECG shows third-degree or complete heart block (Figure 1.2). There \\nis complete dissociation of the atrial rate and the ventricular rate, which is 33/min. The epi -\\nsodes of loss of consciousness are called Stokes–Adams attacks and are caused by self-limited \\nrapid tachyarrhythmias at the onset of heart block or transient asystole. Although these have \\nbeen intermittent in the past, he is now in stable complete heart block, and if this continues, \\nthe slow ventricular rate will be associated with reduced cardiac output, which may cause \\nfatigue, dizziness on exertion or heart failure. Intermittent failure of the escape rhythm may \\ncause syncope.\\nOn examination, the occasional rises in the jugular venous pressure are intermittent ‘cannon’ \\na-waves as the right atrium contracts against a closed tricuspid valve. In addition, the inten -\\nsity of the first heart sound will vary.\\n! Differential diagnosis\\nThe differential diagnosis of transient loss of consciousness splits into neurological and \\nvascular causes. A witness is very helpful in differentiation. Neurological causes are \\nvarious forms of epilepsy, often with associated features. Vascular causes are related to \\nlocal or general reduction in cerebral blood flow. Local reduction may occur in transient \\nischaemic attacks or vertebrobasilar insufficiency. A more global reduction, often with \\npallor, occurs with arrhythmias, postural hypotension and vasovagal faints.\\nThe treatment should be insertion of a pacemaker. If the rhythm in complete heart block is \\nstable, then a permanent pacemaker should be inserted as soon as this can be arranged. This \\nshould be a dual-chamber system pacing the atria, then the ventricles (DDD, dual sensing \\nand pacing, triggered by atrial sensing, inhibited by ventricular sensing) or possibly a ven -\\ntricular pacing system (VVI, pacing the ventricle, inhibited by ventricular sensing).

The positive family history increases the \\nrisk of ischaemic heart disease, but there are no other risk factors evident from the history and \\nexamination. Chest pain due to pericarditis is usually sharp and pleuritic, and exacerbated \\nby inspiration or coughing. The relief from sitting up and leaning forward is typical of pain \\noriginating in the pericardium. The ECG shows elevation of the ST segment, which is concave \\nupwards, typical of pericarditis and unlike the upward convexity found in the ST elevation \\nafter myocardial infarction. ST changes are typically present in most leads in acute pericardi-\\ntis, unlike the changes in myocardial infarction which are limited to anatomical groupings of \\nleads that correspond to the area of the infarct.\\nThe story of an upper respiratory tract infection shortly before suggests that this may well have \\na viral aetiology. The viruses commonly involved in pericarditis are Coxsackie B viruses. The \\nabsence of a pericardial rub does not rule out pericarditis. Rubs often vary in intensity and \\nmay not always be audible. If this diagnosis was suspected, it is often worth listening again on \\na number of occasions for the rub. Pericardial rubs have a scratchy quality that is best heard \\nwith the diaphragm of the stethoscope. Pericarditis often involves some adjacent myocardial \\ninflammation, and this could explain the rise in troponin levels. As pericarditis is an inflam -\\nmatory disease, the white cell count, ESR and serum CRP are often raised. Echocardiography \\noften shows a small pericardial effusion, with tamponade being rare.\\nPericarditis may occur as a complication of a myocardial infarction, but this tends to occur \\na day or more later—inflammation either as a direct result of death of the underlying heart \\nmuscle or as a later immunological effect (Dressler’s syndrome). Pericarditis also occurs as \\npart of various connective tissue disorders, tuberculosis, uraemia and involvement from \\nother local infections or tumours. Myocardial infarction is not common at the age of 34 \\nyears, but it certainly occurs. Other causes of chest pain, such as oesophageal pain or muscu -\\nloskeletal pain, are not suggested by the history and investigations.\\nA subsequent rise in antibody titres against Coxsackie virus suggested a viral pericarditis. \\nSymptoms and ECG changes resolved in 4–5 days. An echocardiogram showed a small peri -\\ncardial efflusion and good left ventricular muscle function. The symptoms settled with rest \\nand non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.\\nKey Points\\n•\\tST segment elevation that is concave upwards is characteristic of pericarditis.\\n•\\tViral pericarditis in young people is most often caused by Coxsackie viruses.\\n•\\tMyocarditis may be associated with pericarditis, and muscle function should be \\nassessed on echocardiogram and damage assessed from troponin measurements.'),\n",

These findings would be compatible with a diagnosis of bronchiectasis. The pulmonary \\narteries are prominent, suggesting a degree of pulmonary hypertension. The distribution is \\ntypical of that found in cystic fibrosis, where the changes are most evident in the upper lobes. \\nMost other forms of bronchiectasis are more likely to occur in the lower lobes, where drain -\\nage by gravity is less effective. High-resolution computed tomography (CT) of the lungs is the \\nbest way to diagnose bronchiectasis and to define its extent and distribution. In younger and \\nmilder cases of cystic fibrosis, the predominant organisms in the sputum are Haemophilus \\ninfluenzae and Staphylococcus aureus. Later, as more lung damage occurs, Pseudomonas \\naeruginosa is a common pathogen. Once present in the lungs in cystic fibrosis, it is difficult or \\nimpossible to remove it completely.\\nCystic fibrosis should always be considered when there is a story of repeated chest infec -\\ntions in a young person. Although it presents most often below the age of 20 years, diagnosis \\nmay be delayed until the 20s, 30s, 40s or later in milder cases. Associated problems occur in \\nthe pancreas (malabsorption, diabetes), sinuses and liver. It has become evident that some \\npatients are affected more mildly, especially those with the less-common genetic variants. \\nThese milder cases may only be affected by the chest problems of cystic fibrosis and have little \\nor no malabsorption from the pancreatic insufficiency.\\n! Differential diagnosis\\nThe differential diagnosis in this young man would be other causes of diffuse bron -\\nchiectasis, such as agammaglobulinaemia or immotile cilia. Respiratory function \\nshould be measured to see the degree of functional impairment. Bronchiectasis in \\nthe upper lobes may occur in tuberculosis or in allergic bronchopulmonary aspergil -\\nlosis associated with asthma.\\nThe common diagnostic test for cystic fibrosis is to measure the electrolytes in the sweat, \\nwhere there is an abnormally high concentration of sodium and chloride. At the age of 19 \\nyears, the sweat test may be less reliable. It is more specific if repeated after the administration \\nof fludrocortisone. An alternative would be to have the potential difference across the nasal \\nepithelium measured at a centre with a special interest in cystic fibrosis. Cystic fibrosis has \\nan autosomal recessive inheritance with the commonest genetic abnormality D F508 found \\nin 85 per cent of cases. The gene is responsible for the protein controlling chloride transport \\nacross the cell membrane. The commoner genetic abnormalities can be identified, and the \\ncurrent battery of genetic tests identifies well over 95 per cent of cases. However, the absence \\nof DF508 and other common abnormalities would not rule out cystic fibrosis related to the \\nless-common genetic variants.\\nIn later stages, lung transplantation can be considered. Since the identification of the genetic \\nabnormality, trials of gene-replacement therapy have begun.\\nManagement should be at a centre with experience in the management of adult cystic fibrosis. \\nTreatment at such centres for children, adolescents and adults is associated with improved \\noutcomes.'),\n",

This does not reach the diagnos -\\ntic criteria for asthma, but it is suspicious. The mean daily variation in peak flow from the \\nrecordings is 36  L/\\nmin, and the mean evening peak flow is 453  L/\\nmin, giving a mean diur -\\nnal variation of 8 per cent. There is a small diurnal variation in normals, and a variation of \\n>15 per cent is diagnostic of asthma. In this patient the label of ‘bronchitis’ as a child was \\nprobably asthma. The family history of an atopic condition (hay fever in a brother) and the \\ntriggering of the cough by exercise and going out in the cold also suggest bronchial hyper -\\nresponsiveness typical of asthma.\\nPatients with a chronic persistent cough of unexplained cause should have a chest X-ray. \\nWhen the X-ray is clear the cough is likely to be produced by one of three main causes in \\nnon-smokers. Around half of such cases have asthma or will go on to develop asthma over \\nthe next few years. Half of the rest have rhinitis or sinusitis with a postnasal drip. In around \\n20 per cent the cough is related to gastro-oesophageal reflux. A small number of cases will \\nbe caused by otherwise-unsuspected problems such as foreign bodies, bronchial ‘adenoma’, \\nsarcoidosis or fibrosing alveolitis. Cough is a common side effect in patients treated with \\nangiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors.\\nIn this patient the diagnosis of asthma was confirmed with an exercise test, which was associ-\\nated with a 25 per cent drop in FEV after completion of 6 min of vigorous exercise. Alternative \\nbronchoprovocation tests include the use of inhaled methacholine or histamine, and a fall in \\nFEV\\n1 greater than 20 per cent.\\nAfter the exercise test, an inhaled steroid was given, and the cough settled after 1 week. The \\ninhaled steroid was discontinued after 4 weeks and replaced by a β\\n2-agonist to use before \\nexercise. However, the cough recurred with more evident wheeze and shortness of breath, \\nand treatment was changed back to an inhaled steroid with a β\\n2-agonist as needed. If control \\nwas not established, the next step would be to check inhaler technique and treatment adher -\\nence and to consider adding a long-acting β2-agonist. In some cases, the persistent dry cough \\nassociated with asthma may require more vigorous treatment than this. Inhaled steroids for \\na month or more or even a 2-week course of oral steroids may be needed to relieve the cough. \\nThe successful management of dry cough relies on establishing the correct diagnosis and \\ntreating it vigorously.\\nKey Points\\n•\\tThe three commonest causes of persistent dry cough with a normal chest X-ray are \\nasthma (50 per cent), sinusitis and postnasal drip (25 per cent) and reflux oesopha -\\ngitis (20 per cent).\\n•\\tAsthma may present as a cough (cough-variant asthma) with little or no airflow \\nobstruction initially, although this develops later.\\n•\\tPersistent cough with normal chest examination is unlikely to have a bacterial cause \\nor respond to antibiotic treatment.'),\n",

Cholecystitis is most common in obese, middle-aged \\nwomen and classically is triggered by eating a fatty meal. Cholecystitis is usually caused \\nby a gallstone impacting in the cystic duct. Continued secretion by the gallbladder leads \\nto increased pressure and inflammation of the gallbladder wall. Bacterial infection is usu -\\nally by Gram-negative organisms and anaerobes. Ischaemia in the distended gallbladder \\ncan lead to perforation, causing either generalized peritonitis or formation of a localized \\nabscess. Alternatively the stone can spontaneously disimpact and the symptoms spontane -\\nously improve. Gallstones can become stuck in the common bile duct, leading to cholangitis \\nor pancreatitis. Rarely, gallstones can perforate through the inflamed gallbladder wall into \\nthe small intestine and cause intestinal obstruction (gallstone ileus).\\nThe typical symptom of acute cholecystitis is sudden-onset right upper quadrant abdominal \\npain that radiates into the back. An episode of prolonged right upper quadrant pain associ -\\nated with fever, suggests acute cholecystits rather than simple biliary colic.

The number of spider \\nnaevi is more than the accepted normal of three. The most common cause of chronic liver \\ndisease is alcohol. He is at increased risk of alcohol misuse because he works in the cater -\\ning business. His symptoms of morning nausea and vomiting are typical of alcohol misuse. \\nChronic alcohol excess would account for his cushingoid appearance due to the increases \\nof adrenocorticotrophic hormone [ACTH] secretion). Macrocytic anaemia can be due to \\ndietary folate deficiency or the direct toxic action of alcohol on the bone marrow. The rise in \\nbilirubin is insufficient to cause jaundice. The low serum albumin and raised international \\nnormalised ratio (INR) may be due to impaired synthetic function of clotting factors pro -\\nduced by the liver. Thrombocytopenia may be from platelet sequestration in an enlarged \\nspleen as a result of portal hypertension from liver cirrhosis.\\nHowever, his alcohol intake is too low to be consistent with the diagnosis of alcoholic liver \\ndisease. When the provisional diagnosis is discussed with him, though, he eventually admits \\nthat his alcohol intake has been at least 40–50 units per week for the last 20 years. His alcohol \\nintake has increased further during the last year after his marriage had ended.\\nFurther investigations include the measurement of hepatitis viral serology, which was nega -\\ntive, and an ultrasound of the abdomen. Ultrasound showed moderate ascites, a slight reduc-\\ntion in liver size and an increase in splenic length of 2–3\\n cm\\n. There was no evidence of a \\nhepatoma. These findings indicate that portal hypertension has developed.\\nThe crucial aim in management is to impress upon the patient the necessity to stop drinking \\nalcohol and to affect this by attending an alcohol addiction unit. Acute management should \\ninclude an alcohol withdrawal regimen with diazepam or chlordiazepoxide to reduce the \\nrisk of withdrawal seizures. Attention needs to be paid to nutrition. Intravenous thiamine \\nshould be given to prevent Wernicke’s encephalopathy. Vitamin K is used to correct clotting \\nabnormalities. An ascitic tap should be performed to exclude spontaneous bacterial perito -\\nnitis (which maybe asymptomatic). Treatment of ascites includes a low sodium diet and spi -\\nronolactone. Daily weights should be used to measure fluid losses. Therapeutic paracentesis \\nwith concomitant albumin infusion can be used if the ascites is diuretic resistant or very \\nuncomfortable. Surveillance endoscopy and banding of oesophageal varices should be con -\\nsidered in this patient, as there is evidence of portal hypertension. If oesophageal varices are \\npresent, propranolol can be used to reduce portal hypertension and prevent further variceal \\nformation.\\nIn this patient attendance at the addiction unit was fitful; he continued to drink heavily, and \\nhe died 3 years later as a result of a second bleed from oesophageal varices.\\nKey Points\\n•\\tPatients who drink excessive amounts of alcohol will often disguise this fact in their \\nhistory\\n•\\tAlcoholic liver disease has a poor prognosis if the alcohol intake is not terminated.'),\n",

The biochemical results show abnormal liver \\nfunction tests with a predominant change in the transaminases, indicating a hepatocellular \\nrather than an obstructive problem in the liver. This might be caused by hepatitis A, B or C. \\nThe raised white count is compatible with acute hepatitis. Homosexuality and intravenous \\ndrug abuse are risk factors for hepatitis B and C. Other viral infections, such as cytomegalo-\\nvirus and herpes simplex virus, are possible. As the drug ingestion history is unclear, there \\nis a possibility of a drug-induced hepatitis. The prodromal joint symptoms suggest a viral \\ninfection as the cause, and this is more common with hepatitis B. Serological tests can be \\nused to see whether there are immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibodies indicating acute infec -\\ntion with one of these viruses, to confirm the diagnosis. Viral loads can also be measured. \\nThe reported negative HIV test 6 months earlier makes an HIV-associated condition unlikely \\nalthough patients are not always reliable in their accounts of HIV tests, and HIV seroconver -\\nsion should also be considered.\\nThis man has acute hepatitis B infection. About 30% of cases develop jaundice. Treatment is \\nbasically supportive in the acute phase. Antiviral drugs are not indicated in the vast major -\\nity of patients with acute hepatitis B. The prothrombin time in this patient is raised slightly \\nbut not enough to be an anxiety or an indicator of very severe disease. Liver function will \\nneed to be measured to monitor enzyme levels as a guide to progress. Alcohol and any other \\nhepatotoxic drug intake should be avoided until liver function tests are back to normal. Rare \\ncomplications of the acute illness are fulminant hepatic failure, aplastic anaemia, myocardi -\\ntis and vasculitis. The opportunity should be taken to advise him about the potential dangers \\nof his intake of cigarettes, drugs and alcohol, and of sexually transmitted diseases and to \\noffer him appropriate support in these areas. HBV can survive outside the body for some \\ntime and he should advise his flatmates not to share razors and toothbrushes with him. They \\nshould consider being vaccinated. Only about 5% of adults with acute hepatitis B will develop \\nchronic infection. Patients with alcoholic liver disease who are infected with hepatitis B have \\na worse liver prognosis.\\nKey Points\\n•\\tViral hepatitis is often associated with a prodrome of arthralgia and flu-like symptoms.\\n•\\tConfirmatory evidence should be sought for patients’ reports of HIV test results.\\n•\\tSexual transmission and intravenous drug use are the main methods of transmission \\nof hepatitis B in adults in the developed world.\\n•\\tAcute hepatitis B infection is a notifiable disease in the UK.'),\n",

These are \\ntypical symptoms of end stage kidney failure.\\nThe elevated urea and creatinine levels confirm renal failure but do not distinguish between \\nacute and chronic renal failure. Usually, in the former, there is evidence of either a systemic \\nillness or some other obvious precipitating cause (e.g. use of nephrotoxic drugs/prolonged \\nepisode of hypotension), whereas in the latter there is a prolonged history of general malaise. \\nIf the patient has had previous blood tests measuring serum creatinine, these will be infor -\\nmative about the progression of deterioration of renal function. In this patient, the anaemia \\nand hyperparathyroidism (raised alkaline phosphatase) are features indicating chronic -\\nity of the renal failure. The normochromic, normocytic anaemia is predominantly due to \\nerythropoietin deficiency (the kidney is the major source of erythropoietin production). \\nHyperparathyroidism is a result of elevated serum phosphate levels due to decreased renal \\nclearance of phosphate and reduced vitamin D levels (the kidney is the site of hydroxylation \\nof 25-hydroxycholecalciferol to the active form 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol). A hand X-ray \\nshowing the typical appearances of hyperparathyroidism (erosion of the terminal phalanges \\nand subperiosteal erosions of the radial aspects of the middle phalanges) can help to confirm \\nlong-standing renal failure.\\nRenal ultrasound is the essential investigation. Ultrasound will accurately size the kid -\\nneys and identify obvious causes for renal failure, such as polycystic kidney disease or \\nobstruction causing bilateral hydronephrosis. Asymmetrically sized kidneys suggest reflux \\nnephropathy or renovascular disease. In this case, ultrasound showed two small (8\\n cm\\n) \\nechogenic kidneys consistent with long-standing renal failure. A renal biopsy in this case \\nis not appropriate as biopsies of small kidneys have a high incidence of bleeding compli -\\ncations, and the sample obtained would show extensive glomerular and tubulointerstitial \\nfibrosis and may not identify the original disease. The patient’s renal failure may have been \\ndue to hypertension or a primary glomerulonephritis such as immunoglobulin A (IgA) \\nnephropathy. African-Caribbeans are more prone to develop hypertensive renal failure \\nthan other racial groups.\\nAntihypertensive medications are needed to treat her blood pressure adequately, oral phos -\\nphate binders and vitamin D preparations to control her secondary hyperparathyroidism, \\nand erythropoietin injections to treat her anaemia. The case raises the dilemma of whether \\ndialysis is appropriate in this patient. Hospital-based haemodialysis and home-based perito -\\nneal dialysis are the options available. Her age and comorbid illnesses preclude renal trans -\\nplantation. Conservative management without dialysis may be appropriate in this case.\\nKey Points\\n•\\tPatients often become symptomatic due to renal failure only when their glomerular \\nfiltration rate (GFR) is less than 15\\n mL\\n/min and thus may present with end-stage renal \\nfailure.\\n•\\tPrevious measurements of serum creatinine enable the rate of deterioration of renal \\nfunction to be known.\\n•\\tRenal ultrasound is the key imaging investigation.'),\n",

Pyelonephritis may also mimic other conditions, such as \\nacute appendicitis, acute cholecystitis, acute pancreatitis and lower lobe pneumonia. There is \\nusually marked tenderness over the kidneys both posteriorly and anteriorly. Severe untreated \\ninfection may lead to septic shock.\\nThe raised white cell count and CRP are consistent with an acute bacterial infection. \\nMicroscopic haematuria, proteinuria and leucocytes in the urine occur because of inflamma-\\ntion in the urinary tract. The presence of bacteria in the urine is confirmed by the reduction \\nof nitrates to nitrites.\\nThis woman should be admitted. Blood and urine cultures should be taken, and she should \\nbe commenced on intravenous fluids and antibiotics until the organism is identified, and \\nthen an oral antibiotic to which the organism is sensitive can be used. Initial therapy could \\nbe with gentamicin and ampicillin or ciprofloxacin. She should have a renal ultrasound scan \\nto exclude any evidence of obstruction. In patients with obstructive uropathy, infection may \\nlead to a pyonephrosis with severe loin pain, fever, septic shock and renal failure. If there \\nis evidence of a hydronephrosis in the context of urinary sepsis, a nephrostomy should be \\ninserted urgently to prevent these complications.\\nPatients with an uncomplicated renal infection should be treated with a 2-week course of \\nantibiotics and then have a repeat urine culture 10–14 days after treatment has finished to \\nconfirm eradication of infection. In patients with infection complicated by stones or renal \\nscarring, a 6-week course of treatment should be given.\\nKey Points\\n•\\tAcute pyelonephritis may present with or without preceding lower urinary tract \\nsymptoms.\\n•\\tRenal ultrasound should be performed within 24  h of a dmission to exclude urinary \\ntract obstruction.\\n•\\tAntibiotics should be continued for at least 2 weeks in cases of acute pyelonephritis \\nto minimize the risk of relapse.'),\n",

Fat accumulation causes a “moon face”, a “buffalo hump” and enlarged \\nfat pads in the supraclavicular fossae. The hyperglycaemia and hypokalaemia would fit this \\ndiagnosis. In addition psychiatric disturbances, typically depression, may occur in Cushing’s \\nsyndrome. Cushing’s disease is due to a pituitary adenoma secreting adrenocorticotrophic \\nhormone (ACTH). The term Cushing’s syndrome is a wider one and encompasses a group of \\ndisorders caused by overproduction of cortisol.\\n! Causes of Cushing’s syndrome\\n• ACTH secretion by a basophil adenoma of the anterior pituitary gland (Cushing’s \\nd\\nisease).\\n• Ectopic ACTH secretion (e.g. from a bronchial carcinoma), often causing a massive \\nr\\nelease of cortisol and a severe and rapid onset of symptoms.\\n• Primary adenoma/carcinoma of the adrenal cortex (suppressed ACTH).\\n• Iatrogenic: corticosteroid treatment. This is the commonest cause in day-to-day clini-\\nc\\nal practice.\\nThis patient’s primary presenting complaint is rapid-onset obesity. The principal causes of \\nobesity are\\n•\\t genetic;\\n•\\t environmental: excessive food intake, lack of exercise;\\n•\\t hormonal: hypothyroidism, Cushing’s syndrome, polycystic ovaries and \\nhyperprolactinaemia; and\\n•\\t alcohol-induced pseudo-Cushing’s syndrome.\\nThis patient should be investigated by an endocrinologist. The first point is to establish that \\nthis man has abnormal cortisol secretion. There should be loss of the normal diurnal rhythm \\nwith an elevated midnight cortisol level or increased urinary conjugated cortisol excretion. A \\ndexamethasone suppression test would normally suppress cortisol excretion. It is then impor-\\ntant to exclude common causes of abnormal cortisol excretion, such as stress/depression or \\nalcohol abuse. Measurement of ACTH levels distinguishes between adrenal (low ACTH) and \\npituitary/ectopic (high ACTH) causes. This patient drinks alcohol moderately and has a nor -\\nmal gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase. His depression seems to be a consequence of his corti -\\nsol excess rather than a cause as he has no psychiatric history.\\nHis ACTH level is elevated. Bronchial carcinoma is a possibility as he is a heavy smoker, and \\nthe onset of his Cushing’s syndrome has been rapid. However his chest X-ray is normal. In \\nthis man a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan (T1-weighted coronal image) through the \\npituitary shows a hypointense microadenoma (Figure\\xa0 11.1, arrow). This can be treated with \\nsurgery or radiotherapy. Transsphenoidal microadenomectomy is the treatment of choice as \\nit cures the patient and leaves them with normal hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal function.'),\n",

She presents with a com-\\nbination of character change, back pain, abdominal pain and constipation. Abdominal pain \\nand constipation might be related to opiate analgesic therapy but not to paracetamol and \\nibuprofen. The abnormal findings of low values for haemoglobin, white cells and platelets and \\nmildly abnormal renal function are found in the investigations.\\nThe haematological investigations suggest that there is a bone marrow problem which is \\nlikely to be related to the bony tenderness in the thoracic spine. The character change and \\nthe abdominal symptoms, with the finding of a possible bony problem, raise the possibility \\nof hypercalcaemia which would explain all these findings.\\nThe clinical manifestations of hypercalcaemia include confusion, reduced concentration, \\nfatigue, muscle weakness, abdominal pain, nausea, constipation, polydipsia, polyuria, dehy -\\ndration, nephrolithiasis, hypertension, short QT on ECG, bone changes (osteitis fibrosa cys -\\ntica, brown tumours).\\n90% of cases of hypercalcaemia are related to primary hyperparathyroidism or malignancy, \\nwith multiple myeloma as a common malignancy. Other causes are\\n!\\n•\\t sarcoidosis\\n•\\t ectopic hormone production in squamous cell lung cancer\\n•\\t tertiary hyperparathyroidism (in renal failure)\\n•\\t thyrotoxicosis\\n•\\t vitamin D intoxication\\n•\\t thiazide diuretics (mild hypercalcaemia)\\n•\\t adrenal insufficiency\\n•\\t tuberculosis\\nThe investigations indicating bone marrow depression here and the bone pain suggest that \\nmalignancy is the likely cause. The high ESR could be compatible with any disseminated \\nmalignancy but is characteristic of multiple myeloma.\\nThe important first investigations here are to confirm the hypercalcaemia and to investigate the \\nback pain. When interpreting serum calcium the serum albumin should be measured and the \\ncalcium level corrected for abnormalities in albumin. Also the serum phosphate may help, being \\nusually low in hyperparathyroidism and high in malignancy. In the presence of hypercalcaemia \\nthe parathyroid hormone level will be below normal unless there is hyperparathyroidism.\\nIn this case the serum calcium and phosphate were both raised and the X-rays of the thoracic \\nspine and skull (see Figure 12.1) showed lytic bone lesions typical of multiple myeloma. Plain \\nX-rays are preferred to a radio-isotope bone scan which may not show hot spots from radio -\\nisotope accumulation in osteoblasts typical of other malignant bone involvement.'),\n",

The most likely diagnosis is motor neurone disease. This is a degenera -\\ntive disease of unknown cause that affects the motor neurones of the spinal cord, the cranial \\nnerve nuclei, and the motor cortex. The disease usually presents between the ages of 50 and \\n70 years.\\nWeakness and wasting of the muscles of one hand or arm is the commonest presentation. \\nWeakness is most marked after exertion. Painful cramps of the forearm muscles are common \\nin the early phases of the disease. Patients may present with lower limb weakness or with dys-\\narthria or dysphagia. The characteristic physical sign of this condition is fasciculation, which \\nis an irregular rapid contraction of segments of muscle, caused by denervation of the muscle \\nfrom a lower motor neurone lesion. As in this man, reflexes can be brisk due to loss of cortical \\nmotor neurones. There is no sensory loss.\\nMotor neurone disease is divided into five types:\\n•\\t amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (commonest, upper and lower motor neurone)\\n•\\t primary lateral sclerosis (upper motor neurone)\\n•\\t progressive muscular atrophy (lower motor neurone)\\n•\\t progressive bulbar palsy (bulbar lower motor neurone)\\n•\\t pseudobulbar palsy (bulbar upper motor neurone)\\nIn advanced cases diagnosis is easy, but early cases are more problematic. Limb weak -\\nness worsening with fatigue may be confused with myasthenia gravis. Dysphagia and \\ndysarthria in the elderly are much more commonly due to the pseudobulbar palsy of \\ncerebrovascular disease. Cervical myelopathy is another common cause of wasting and \\nfasciculation of the upper limbs without sensory loss. Brachial plexus lesions from trauma \\nor invasion by an apical lung tumour (Pancoast tumour) may affect one arm. A predomi -\\nnant motor peripheral neuropathy causes a symmetrical pattern of weakness, and reflexes \\nare reduced.\\nUnfortunately motor neurone disease is a progressive and incurable condition. Patients \\ntend to develop a spastic weakness of the legs. Bulbar palsy causes dysarthria and dysphasia. \\nSphincter function is usually not affected. Intellect is generally not affected.\\nThere is no curative treatment for this condition. The mean duration of survival from presen-\\ntation is between 2 and 4 years. The patient and his family will have to be told of the diagnosis \\nand prognosis. Support must be given by a multidisciplinary team. As the disease progresses \\nand speech deteriorates communication may be helped by computer-linked devices. A feed -\\ning gastrostomy may be required to enable adequate calorie intake. Non-invasive ventilation \\ncan be used to help respiratory failure, but death usually occurs from bronchopneumonia.\\nKey Points\\n•\\tMotor neuron disease most commonly starts with weakness and wasting of the \\nmuscles of one hand.\\n•\\tFasciculation of the muscles is characteristic of this condition.\\n•\\tThe absence of sensory loss helps in the differential diagnosis.'),\n",

Myasthenia gravis is due \\nto the presence of acetylcholine receptor antibodies causing impaired neuromuscular trans -\\nmission. It characteristically affects the external ocular, bulbar, neck and shoulder girdle \\nmuscles. Weakness is worse after repetitive movements, which cause acetylcholine depletion \\nfrom the presynaptic terminals. The onset is usually gradual. Ptosis of the upper lids is often \\nassociated with diplopia due to weakness of the external ocular muscles. Speech may become \\nsoft when the patient is tired. Symptoms are usually worse in the evenings and better in the \\nmornings. Permanent paralysis eventually develops in some muscle groups. In severe cases \\nrespiratory weakness occurs.\\n! Differential diagnoses of generalized muscle weakness\\n• Motor neurone disease : suggested clinically by muscle fasciculation and later by \\nmarked muscle weakness.\\n• Muscular dystrophies : selective muscular weakness occurs in specific diseases (e.g. \\nfacioscapulohumeral dystrophy). There is usually a family history.\\n• Dystrophia myotonica : this causes ptosis, wasting of the masseter, temporal and \\nsternomastoid muscles and distal muscular atrophy. There is a characteristic facial \\nappearance with frontal baldness, expressionless facies and sunken cheeks. There \\nmay be gonadal atrophy and mental retardation. There is usually a family history. \\nThe electromyogram (EMG) is diagnostic.\\n• Polymyositis: this may have an acute or chronic onset. A skin rash and joint pains are \\ncommon. The creatine kinase level is raised, and a muscle biopsy is diagnostic.\\n• Miscellaneous myopathies : thyrotoxic, hypothyroid, Cushing’s, alcoholic.\\n• Non-metastatic associations of malignancy : thymoma is associated with myasthenia \\ngravis in 10 per cent of cases; the Eaton–Lambert myasthenic syndrome is associ -\\nated with small-cell lung carcinoma.\\nThis patient should be investigated by a neurologist. The EMG will demonstrate fatiguability \\nin response to repetitive supramaximal stimulation. Intravenous injection of edrophonium \\n(Tensilon) will increase muscular power for a few minutes. Blood should be assayed for acetyl-\\ncholine receptor antibodies (present in 90 per cent). Computed tomography (CT) of the tho-\\nrax should be performed to detect the presence of a thymoma or lung cancer. Corticosteroids \\nare the drugs of first choice. Anticholinesterase drugs greatly improve muscle power but have \\nmany side effects. Thymectomy should be considered. It is most effective within 5 years of \\ndiagnosis and when there is no thymoma.\\nKey Points\\n•\\tMyasthenia gravis is a cause of abnormal muscular fatiguability.\\n•\\tIn its initial stages it affects certain characteristic muscle groups.'),\n",

This dis-\\nease classically presents with a triad of symptoms (although all three may not always be present):\\n•\\t seronegative arthritis affecting mainly lower limb joints\\n•\\t conjunctivitis\\n•\\t non-specific urethritis (NSU).\\nThe trigger can be non-gonococcal urethritis ( Chlamydia trachomatis )) or certain enteric \\ninfections ( Salmonella, Shigella, Yerinia and Campylobacter . This patient is likely to have \\ncontracted NSU after sexual intercourse in Thailand. On direct questioning he admitted to \\nthe presence of a urethral discharge. The acute arthritis is typically a monoarthritis but can \\ndevelop into a chronic relapsing destructive arthritis affecting the knees and feet and causing \\nsacroiliitis and spondylitis. Tendinitis and plantar fasciitis may occur. The red eyes are due to \\nconjunctivitis and anterior uveitis and can recur with flares of the arthritis.

His knee should be aspirated. A Gram stain will exclude a \\npyogenic infection, and birefringent microscopy can be used to detect uric acid or pyrophos -\\nphate crystals. This patient should be given non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) \\nfor the pain, and he may require intraarticular steroids or oral prednisolone. Sulfasalazine is \\nused in refractory cases.. If his disease relapses he should be referred to a rheumatologist.

The patient has a history of some hip \\npains, but this and the Heberden’s nodes are common findings in an 80-year-old woman, \\nrelated to osteoarthritis. The blood results show a raised white cell count and ESR, a raised \\nblood sugar, and renal function at the upper limit of normal.\\n! Differential diagnoses of pain in the knee\\nThe differential diagnosis includes trauma, septic arthritis, gout and pseudogout.\\nThe recent introduction of a thiazide diuretic for treatment of the hypertension increases \\nthe suspicion of gout. Pseudogout is caused by deposition of calcium pyrophosphate crys -\\ntals and would be expected to show calcification in the articular cartilage in the knee \\njoint. The X-rays here show some joint space narrowing but no evidence of calcification \\nin the articular cartilage. The fever, high white cell count and ESR are compatible with \\nacute gout. The raised glucose may also be a side effect of thiazide diuretics. If this remains \\nafter the acute arthritis has subsided, then it may need further treatment. Precipitation \\nof gout by thiazides is more likely in older women, particularly in the presence of renal \\nimpairment and diabetes. It may involve the hands, be polyarticular, and can affect exist -\\ning Heberden’s nodes.\\nThe serum uric acid level is likely to be raised, but this occurs commonly without evidence \\nof acute gout. The definitive investigation is aspiration of the joint. The fluid should be sent \\nfor culture and inspection with a specific request for inspection for crystals. A high white \\ncell count would be expected in an acute inflammatory arthritis. The diagnosis is made from \\nthe needle-like crystals of uric acid, which are negatively birefringent under polarized light, \\nunlike the positively birefringent crystals of calcium pyrophosphate.\\nIn this case the pain in the joint was partly relieved by the aspiration. Treatment with a non-\\nsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug should be covered by a proton pump inhibitor in view of \\nher history of heartburn and indigestion. The thiazide diuretic was changed to an angioten -\\nsin-converting enzyme inhibitor as treatment for her hypertension, and the blood glucose \\nelevation resolved. A short course of prednisolone can also be used in acute gout. A xanthine \\noxidase inhibitor such as allopurinol might be considered if the serum urate remained raised \\nor the condition did not settle after stopping the thiazide diuretic.\\nKey Points\\n•\\tA careful drug history is an essential part of the history.\\n•\\tThiazide diuretics can precipitate diabetes and gout, especially in the elderly.'),\n",

She has \\nprofound thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 9 ×  109/L. An increased tendency to \\nbleed or bruise can be due to platelet, coagulation or blood vessel abnormalities. Platelet/\\nvessel wall defects cause spontaneous purpura in the skin and mucous membranes or \\nimmediately after trauma. A lack of a history of trauma and frequent severe bruising \\nraises the possibility of a bleeding diathesis. Disorders of platelet function usually cause \\nimmediate bleeding after a procedure whereas coagulation defects cause haematomas \\nand haemarthroses usually with a time delay after trauma. The age of onset of bleeding \\nmay distinguish between a congenital and an acquired cause of bleeding. The onset of \\nbleeding in later life suggests an acquired condition. Family history may identify a con -\\ndition such as haemophilia. The distribution of bruising may also suggest the diagnosis. \\nThrombocytopenic purpura is most evident over the ankles and pressure areas. Retinal \\nhaemorrhages tend to occur if there is a combination of severe thrombocytopenia and \\nanaemia. Senile purpura and steroid-induced bruising occur mainly on the forearms and \\nbacks of the hands. Henoch–Schönlein purpura typically occurs over the extensor aspects \\nof the limbs and buttocks. Scurvy causes bleeding from the gums and around the hair \\nfollicles. Non-accidental injury in children can present with bruising. It is important to \\ntake a dietary and drug history. Drugs which can cause bruising include anticoagulants, \\nantiplatelet drugs and steroids.\\nPetechiae are small capillary haemorrhages that characteristically develop in crops in areas \\nof increased venous pressure, such as the dependent parts of the body. Petechiae are the \\nsmallest bleeding lesions (pinhead in size), and suggest problems with platelet number or \\nfunction. Purpura are larger in size than petechiae with variable shape and involve bleeding \\ninto subcutaneous tissues. Purpura can be seen in a variety of bleeding disorders, including \\nthrombocytopenia and coagulation cascade disorders. Palpable purpura can be seen in vas -\\nculitic processes such as Henoch–Schönlein purpura.\\nAML is the most common acute leukaemia in adults with a mean age at presentation of 65 \\nyears. Patients with AML generally present with symptoms related to complications of pan -\\ncytopenia (eg, anemia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia), including weakness, breath -\\nlessness and easy fatigability, infections of variable severity, and/or haemorrhagic findings \\nsuch as gingival bleeding, ecchymoses, epistaxis, or menorrhagia. Most patients will have \\nblasts on the peripheral blood smear and the diagnosis is confirmed by the results of a bone \\nmarrow examination. Blast forms must account for at least 20% of the total cellularity of the \\nbone marrow sample.\\nThis patient should be immediately referred to a haematology unit. Platelet transfusion is \\nusually given if there is significant bleeding or the platelet count is less than 15 × 10\\n9/L to \\nprevent a major spontaneous bleed.

Symptoms include headache, fatigue, breath-\\nlessness and dizziness. There is often pallor of the mucous membranes. Profound vitamin \\nB12 deficiency causes a peripheral neuropathy and subacute degeneration of the posterior \\ncolumns and pyramidal tracts in the spinal cord, causing a sensory loss and increased dif -\\nficulty walking. The peripheral neuropathy and pyramidal tract involvement produce the \\ncombination of absent ankle jerks and upgoing plantars. In its most extreme form it can lead \\nto paraplegia, optic atrophy and dementia.\\nVitamin B\\n12 is synthesized by micro-organisms and is obtained by ingesting animal or veg -\\netable products contaminated by bacteria. After ingestion, it is bound by intrinsic factor, \\nsynthesized by gastric parietal cells, and this complex is then absorbed in the terminal ileum. \\nVitamin B\\n12 deficiency is most commonly of a gastric cause (pernicious anaemia due to an \\nautoimmune atrophic gastritis; total gastrectomy), bacterial overgrowth in the small intes -\\ntine destroying intrinsic factor, or a malabsorption from the terminal ileum (surgical resec -\\ntion; Crohn’s disease).\\nPernicious anaemia is the most likely cause of this patient’s vitamin B 12 deficiency. \\nPernicious anaemia is an autoimmune disease with the production of antibodies that \\ninhibit intrinsic factor binding to vitamin B 12 in the stomach. Vitamin B 12 cannot be \\nabsorbed in the terminal ileum unless it is bound to the intrinsic factor. In pernicious \\nanaemia, the MCV can rise to 100–140\\n fL\\n, and oval macrocytes are seen on the blood film. \\nThe reticulocyte count is inappropriately low for the degree of anaemia. The white cell \\ncount is usually moderately reduced. There is often a mild rise in serum bilirubin giving \\nthe patient a ‘lemon-yellow’ complexion.\\nA full dietary history should be taken. Vegans who omit all animal products from their diet \\noften have subclinical vitamin B\\n12 deficiency. Serum vitamin B 12 and folate levels should be \\nmeasured and antibodies to intrinsic factor and parietal cells should be assayed. Intrinsic fac-\\ntor antibodies are virtually specific for pernicious anaemia but are only present in about 50 \\nper cent of cases. Parietal cell antibody is present in 85–90 per cent of patients with pernicious \\nanaemia but can also occur in patients with other causes of atrophic gastritis. A radioactive \\nB\\n12 absorption test (Schilling test) distinguishes gastric from intestinal causes of deficiency. \\nRapid correction of vitamin B 12 is essential using intramuscular hydroxycobalamin to pre -\\nvent cardiac failure and further neurological damage.'),\n",

Longer incubation periods occur in semi-immune individuals and per -\\nsons taking inadequate malaria prophylaxis.The mild haemolytic anaemia with a low platelet \\ncount would be typical findings. Slight enlargement of liver and spleen may occur after a few \\ndays in nonimmune patients with malaria.\\nThe diagnosis should be confirmed by appropriate expert examination of a blood film.\\nThe most important feature in this 24-year-old man is the fever with what sound like rig -\\nors. He has no other specific symptoms. He looks unwell, with tachycardia and some ten -\\nderness in the left upper quadrant that could be related to splenic enlargement. Malaria \\nprophylaxis is often not taken regularly. Even when it is, it does not provide complete \\nprotection against malaria, which should always be suspected in circumstances such \\nas those described here. The risk might be assessed further by finding which parts of \\nNigeria he spent his time in and whether he remembered mosquito bites. Measures to \\navoid mosquito bites such as nets, insect repellants and suitable clothing are an impor -\\ntant part of prevention.\\nHe has no history of intravenous drug abuse or recent risky sexual contact to suggest HIV \\ninfection, although this could not be ruled out. HIV seroconversion can produce a feverish \\nillness but not usually as severe as this. Later in HIV infection an AIDS-related illness would \\noften be associated with a low total lymphocyte count, but this is normal in his case. Other \\nacute viral or bacterial infections are possible but are less likely to explain the abnormal \\nresults of some investigations.\\nThe diagnostic test for malaria is staining of a peripheral blood film with a Wright or \\nGiemsa stain.

The differential \\ndiagnosis is extensive and includes cancer, depression, anaemia, renal failure and endocrine \\ndiseases. In this case the main differential diagnoses are depression and hypothyroidism. \\nHe has a history of depression but currently has no obvious triggers for a further episode of \\ndepression. He is not waking early in the morning or having difficulty getting to sleep, which \\nare common biological symptoms of severe depression. There are a number of clues in this \\ncase to the diagnosis of hypothyroidism. Insidious onset of fatigue, difficulty concentrating, \\nincreased somnolence, constipation and weight gain are features of hypothyroidism. As in \\nthis case there may be a family or past medical history of other autoimmune diseases such \\nas type 1 diabetes mellitus, vitiligo or Addison’s disease. Hypothyroidism typically pres -\\nents in the fifth or sixth decade and is about five times more common in women than men. \\nObstructive sleep apnoea is associated with hypothyroidism and may contribute to daytime \\nsleepiness and fatigue.\\nOn examination the facial appearances and bradycardia are consistent with the diagnosis. \\nCharacteristically, patients with overt hypothyroidism have dry, scaly, cold and thickened \\nskin. There may be a malar flush against the background of the pale facial appearance (‘straw-\\nberries-and-cream appearance’). Scalp hair is usually brittle and sparse, and there may be \\nthinning of the lateral third of the eyebrows. Bradycardia may occur, and the apex beat may \\nbe difficult to locate because of the presence of a pericardial effusion. A classic sign of hypo -\\nthyroidism is the delayed relaxation phase of the ankle jerk. Other neurological syndromes \\nthat may occur in association with hypothyroidism include carpal tunnel syndrome, proxi-\\nmal muscle weakness, a cerebellar syndrome or polyneuritis. Patients may present with psy -\\nchiatric illnesses, including psychoses (‘myxoedema madness’).\\nClues to the diagnosis in the investigations are the mild normochromic, normocytic anae -\\nmia, marginally raised creatinine, and hypercholesterolaemia. The anaemia of hypothyroid -\\nism is typically normochromic, normocytic or macrocytic; microcytic anaemia may occur \\nif there is menorrhagia. A macrocytic anaemia may represent undiagnosed vitamin B\\n12 defi-\\nciency. Renal blood flow is reduced in hypothyroidism, and this can cause the creatinine to \\nbe slightly above the normal range.\\nThe most severe cases of hypothyroidism present with myxoedema coma, with bradycardia, \\nreduced respiratory rate and severe hypothermia. Typically, shivering is absent.\\nIn this case the thyroid function tests showed thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), 73\\n mU\\n/L \\n(normal range <6 mU\\n/L); free thyroxine (T4), 3 pm\\nol/L (normal range 9–22 pm\\nol/L). The high \\nTSH indicates primary hypothyroidism rather than hypopituitarism. The commonest cause \\nof hypothyroidism is autoimmune thyroiditis, and the patient should have thyroid autoanti -\\nbodies assayed.'),\n",

Unilateral oedema is most likely to be \\ndue to a local problem, whereas bilateral leg oedema is usually due to one of the medical con-\\nditions listed. Pitting oedema needs to be distinguished from lymphoedema, which is char -\\nacteristically non-pitting. This is tested by firm pressure with the thumb for approximately 10 \\ns. If the oedema is pitting, an indentation will be present after pressure is removed. This man \\nhas a subacute onset of massive pitting oedema. The major differential diagnoses are cardiac \\nfailure, renal failure, nephrotic syndrome, right heart failure (cor pulmonale) secondary to \\nchronic obstructive airways disease or decompensated chronic liver disease. The frothy urine \\nis a clue to the diagnosis of nephrotic syndrome and is commonly noted by patients with \\nheavy proteinuria.\\nOn examination there were no clinical signs to suggest chronic liver disease. The jugular \\nvenous pressure would be expected to be increased more, and there should have been signs of \\ntricuspid regurgitation (prominent ‘v’ wave, pansystolic murmur loudest on inspiration) and \\ncardiomegaly if the patient had cor pulmonale or biventricular cardiac failure. The patient \\nhas signs of bilateral pleural effusions, which may occur in nephrotic syndrome if there is \\nsufficient fluid retention. The bruising and periorbital purpura are classically seen in patients \\nwith nephrotic syndrome secondary to amyloidosis.\\nThe investigations are consistent with the diagnosis of nephrotic syndrome. Nephrotic syn -\\ndrome is defined by the triad of hypoalbuminaemia (<30\\n g/\\nL), proteinuria (>3 g/\\n24 h)\\n, and \\nhypercholesterolaemia.

Viruses that can cause myocar -\\nditis include Coxsackie B and A, echovirus, adenovirus, influenza, varicella, polio, mumps, \\nrabies, viral hepatitis, rubella, parvovirus B19, Epstein–Barr virus (EBV), cytomegalovirus \\n(CMV), and herpes simplex virus. Myocarditis also may occur during bacteraemia or fungae-\\nmia. Rickettsia and diptheria can cause myocarditis. In rural South America acute infection \\nwith the protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi  causes fever, myocarditis and hepatosplenomegaly, \\nand 10–30 years later this can lead to cardiac failure and conduction system defects (Chagas’ \\ndisease). Cocaine abuse can cause myocarditis and sudden death. Profound hypocalcaemia, \\nhypophosphataemia, and hypomagnaesaemia can all cause myocardial depression.\\nThe clinical picture of myocarditis is non-specific, but common symptoms include myal -\\ngia, fatigue, shortness of breath, pericardial pain and palpitations. Myocarditis should be \\nsuspected in a young person presenting with new onset cardiac symptoms.There is often \\na prodromal viral illness affecting the upper respiratory tract or gastrointestinal system. \\nAutoimmune disease such as lupus should be excluded and a careful social history should be \\ntaken to exclude alcohol or cocaine abuse.The main clinical signs are those of cardiac failure. \\nA pericardial friction rub may be heard in some patients with myopericarditis. Patients usu-\\nally have a marked sinus tachycardia disproportionate to the slight fever. ECG usually shows \\nST segment and T-wave abnormalities. There may be atrial or, more commonly, ventricular \\narrhythmias or signs of conducting system defects. The chest x-ray may be normal if the \\nmyocarditis is mild, but if there is cardiac failure there will be cardiomegaly and pulmonary \\ncongestion. The differential diagnoses in this case include hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, \\npericarditis and myocardial ischaemia.\\nCardiac enzymes such as troponin I or T and creatine kinase are raised. Echocardiography \\nshould be performed to confirm the diagnosis. Echocardiographic changes may be focal affect-\\ning only the right or left ventricle, or global. There is poor contractility of the myocardium. \\nCardiac enzymes such as troponin I or T and creatine kinase are raised. Cardiac magnetic res-\\nonance imaging can detect myocardial oedema and myocyte injury in myocarditis. Coronary \\nangiography may be performed to exclude severe coronary artery disease. Endomyocardial \\nbiopsy is considered depending on the course and severity of the condition. Paired serum \\nsamples should be taken for antibody titres to Coxsackie B and mumps. Coxsackie virus can \\nbe cultured from the throat, stool, blood, myocardium or pericardial fluid.\\nBed rest is the treatment for the period of acute viral myocarditis. Diuretics and angiotensin-\\nconverting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are used to treat cardiac failure. Anticoagulation may \\nbe required for patients with intracardiac thrombi. There is controversy over treatment with \\ncorticosteroids. Corticosteroids tend to be used in patients with a short history, a positive \\nendomyocardial biopsy, and the most severe disease.

Community-acquired pneumonia is most commonly \\ncaused by Streptococcus pneumoniae  or Haemophilus influenzae , but atypical pneumonias \\n(pneumonias caused by ‘atypical’ organisms such as mycoplasma, legionella and chlamydia \\nwithout a normal bacterial cell wall) account for about 5–15 per cent of cases. The 4-day \\nprodromal illness is typical of Legionella pneumonia (2–10 days) compared to pneumococcal \\npneumonia, which tends to present abruptly with fever and shortness of breath. Legionella \\ninfection presents with malaise, myalgia, headache and fever. Patients may develop diar -\\nrhoea and abdominal pain. As the illness progresses the patient develops a dry cough, chest \\npain, shortness of breath and acute confusion. Other potential complications include nephri-\\ntis, endocarditis and myocarditis. On examination, the patient is usually dehydrated, tachy -\\ncardic and tachypnoeic, with widespread rhonchi and crackles. The diffuse infiltrates on chest \\nX-ray suggest atypical pneumonia, whereas a lobar pattern tends to occur with streptococcal \\npneumonia. Hyponatraemia occurs in cases of severe pneumonia and is a poor prognos -\\ntic factor. Hypocalcaemia is another distinctive biochemical abnormality in this condition. \\nConfusion and raised urea are markers of severity (used in the CURB65 criteria of severity). \\nThe high CRP is consistent with a severe infection, and the lymphopenia is a clue to the \\nfact that this patient has an atypical pneumonia. The patient’s arterial blood gases showed \\nmarked hypoxia with compensatory increased ventilation producing the low PaCO\\n2. This \\npatient presumably acquired his infection while on holiday in Spain or Portugal. Legionella  \\noutbreaks have often been due to infected water tanks in warm climates in institutions such \\nas hotels and hospitals.\\nThis man is acutely unwell and needs to be admitted to a high-dependency unit. He needs to \\nreceive a high concentration of inspired oxygen and intravenous fluids to correct his dehy -\\ndration. He may require ventilatory support. He should be started on intravenous antibiotics \\nimmediately. These should cover the common community-acquired pneumonias until the \\nprecise microbiological diagnosis is obtained and the antibiotics can then be rationalized. A \\nstandard combination is cefuroxime and clarithromycin. Blood cultures should be sent and \\nblood sent to screen for antibodies to atypical organisms and influenza. Ten to fourteen days \\nlater a further blood sample should be sent, and a fourfold rise in antibody titre is evidence of \\ncurrent infection. A faster diagnosis is made by testing broncheoalveolar lavage fluid, blood \\nand urine for the presence of Legionella  antigen.\\nKey Points\\n• Legionella is one of the atypical causes of pneumonia.\\n•\\tIt should be suspected if there is an outbreak in an institution or if a case of pneu -\\nmonia fails to respond to antibiotics.\\n• Legionella pneumonia has a 2- to 10-day prodromal period.\\n•\\tLymphopenia, evidence of nephritis, and a diffuse pattern of infiltrates on chest \\nX-ray are other clues to the diagnosis.'),\n",

She has mac -\\nroscopic haematuria, hypertension and impaired renal function. The palpable abdominal \\nmasses in both flanks have the characteristic features of enlarged kidneys. They are ballot -\\ntable and resonant to percussion because of overlying bowel. The other principal causes for \\npalpable kidneys are renal cell carcinoma and massive hydronephrosis. Rest is the best man -\\nagement for cyst bleeding. Gross haematuria rarely lasts for more than a week.\\nADPKD is the most common inherited renal disease, occurring in approximately 1:600 to \\n1:1000 individuals. Although the name ‘ADPKD’ is derived from renal manifestations of cyst \\ngrowth leading to enlarged kidneys and renal failure, this is a systemic disorder manifested \\nby the presence of hepatic cysts, diverticular disease, inguinal hernias, mitral valve prolapse, \\nintracranial aneurysms and hypertension. Flank pain is the most common symptom and \\nmay be caused by cyst rupture, cyst infection or renal calculi. Macroscopic haematuria due \\nto cyst haemorrhage occurs commonly and usually resolves spontaneously. Renal calculi \\noccur in approximately 20 per cent of ADPKD patients (most commonly uric acid stones). \\nHypertension occurs early in the course of this disease, affecting 60% of patients with normal \\nrenal function. Approximately 50% of ADPKD patients will develop end-stage renal failure.\\nAlthough it is not known if this patient’s father had renal disease, it is highly likely that he \\nhad ADPKD and an associated ruptured berry aneurysm as the cause for his subarachnoid \\nhaemorrhage. The patient’s uncle required a renal transplant. The pattern of inheritance in \\nthis family is consistent with an autosomal dominant trait.\\nUltrasound is the preferred initial screening technique as it is cheap, non-invasive and rapid. \\nIt detects cysts as small as 0.5\\n cm\\n. For a certain diagnosis, there should be at least three renal \\ncysts with at least one cyst in each kidney. Computed tomography (CT) and magnetic reso -\\nnance imaging (MRI) are more sensitive techniques for detecting smaller cysts. Ultrasound \\nin this patient shows the typical appearance of multiple cysts (black areas) surrounded by \\nthickened walls (Figure\\xa026.1). She should be referred to a nephrologist for long-term follow-\\nup of her renal failure, and plans should be made for renal replacement therapy. She needs to \\nhave effective blood pressure control with diastolic pressure less than 85\\n mm\\nHg to retard the \\nprogression of her renal failure. Clinical trials are starting of vasopressin receptor antago -\\nnists, which show promise at inhibiting cyst growth.\\nShe should have MRI angiography to exclude an intracranial aneurysm. This is not advocated \\nfor all ADPKD patients but is indicated for those patients with a positive family history of \\naneurysm rupture. The patient’s children should have their blood pressure checked and later \\nbe screened by ultrasound. By age 30 years, 90% of ADPKD patients will have cysts detectable \\nby ultrasound.\\nNinety per cent of ADPKD patients have mutations in the ADPKD1  gene. This gene encodes \\nfor the protein polycystin, which is a membrane glycoprotein that probably mediates cell–cell \\nor cell–matrix interactions. Most remaining patients have mutations in the ADPKD2  gene, \\nwhich codes for polycystin-2, which has structural homology to polycystin and to calcium \\nchannels. ADPKD1 patients generally have an earlier age of onset of hypertension and devel -\\nopment of renal failure as compared to ADPKD2 patients.'),\n",

Rheumatoid \\narthritis is a chronic, systemic inflammatory disorder principally affecting joints in a periph -\\neral symmetrical distribution. The peak incidence is between 35 and 55 years in women and \\n40 and 60 years in men. It is a disease with a long course with exacerbations and remissions. \\nThe acute presentation may occur over the course of a day and be associated with fever and \\nmalaise. More commonly, as in this case, it presents insidiously, and this group has a worse \\nprognosis. Rheumatoid arthritis characteristically affects proximal interphalangeal, meta -\\ncarpophalangeal and wrist joints in the hands and metatarsophalangeal joints, ankles, knees \\nand cervical spine.\\nEarly morning stiffness of the joints is typical of rheumatoid arthritis. As the disease pro -\\ngresses, damage to cartilage, bone and tendons leads to the characteristic deformities of this \\ncondition. Extra-articular features include rheumatoid nodules, vasculitis causing cutaneous \\nnodules and digital gangrene, scleritis, pleural effusions, diffuse pulmonary fibrosis, pulmo -\\nnary nodules, obliterative bronchiolitis, pericarditis and splenomegaly (Felty’s syndrome). \\nThere is usually a normochromic, normocytic anaemia and raised ESR, as seen here. The \\ndegree of anaemia and ESR roughly correlates with disease activity. In this case the raised \\ncreatinine is probably due to the use of diclofenac. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs \\n(NSAIDs) reduce glomerular filtration rate in all patients. Rarely they can cause an acute \\ninterstitial nephritis. In patients with long-standing rheumatoid arthritis, renal infiltration \\nby amyloid may occur.\\n! Differential diagnosis of an acute symmetrical polyarthritis\\n• Osteoarthritis: characteristically affects the distal interphalangeal as well as proxi -\\nmal interphalangeal and first metacarpophalangeal joints.\\n• Rheumatoid arthritis.\\n• Systemic lupus erythematosus : usually causes a mild, flitting, non-erosive arthritis.\\n• Gout: usually starts as monoarthritis.\\n• Seronegative arthritides : ankylosing spondylitis, psoriasis, Reiter’s disease. These \\nusually cause asymmetrical arthritis affecting medium and larger joints as well as the \\nsacroiliac and distal interphalangeal joints.\\n• Acute viral arthritis (e.g. rubella): resolves completely.\\nThis patient should be referred to a rheumatologist for further investigation and manage -\\nment. The affected joints should be X-rayed. If there has been joint damage, the X-rays will \\nshow subluxation, juxta-articular osteoporosis, loss of joint space and bony erosions. A com-\\nmon site for erosions to be found in early rheumatoid arthritis is the fifth metatarsophalan -\\ngeal joint (arrowed in Figure\\xa027.1). Blood tests should be taken for rheumatoid factor (present \\nin rheumatoid arthritis) and anti-DNA antibodies (present in systemic lupus erythematosus). \\nThis patient should be given NSAIDs for analgesia and to reduce joint stiffness to allow her \\nto continue her secretarial work. Disease-modifying drugs such as hydroxychloroquine, sul -\\nfasalazine, methotrexate, or leflunomide should be considered unless the patient settles easily \\non NSAIDs. Addition of an anti-tumour necrosis factor (TNF) antibody is considered where \\nthe disease fails to come under control with methotrexate.'),\n",

Based on the information given here it would be reasonable to explore her anxieties and \\nto reassure the patient that this is very unlikely to represent coronary artery disease and to \\nsubsequently assess the effects of that reassurance. It may well be that she is anxious about the \\ndeath of her grandfather from ischaemic heart disease. He may have had symptoms before \\nhis death that were related to her anxieties. From a risk point of view her grandfather’s death \\nat the age of 77 with no other affected relatives is not a relevant risk factor. She has expressed \\nanxiety already by having her cholesterol measured (and found to be normal).\\nShe has a history that is suspicious of irritable bowel syndrome with persistent pain, irregular \\nbowel habit and normal investigations. Ischaemic chest pain is usually central and generally \\nreproducible with the same stimuli. The associated shortness of breath may reflect overventi -\\nlation coming on with the pain and giving her dizziness and palpitations.\\nThe characteristics of the pain and associated shortness of breath should be explored fur -\\nther. Asthma can sometimes be described as tightness or pain in the chest, and she has sea -\\nsonal rhinitis and a family history of asthma. Gastrointestinal causes of pain such as reflux \\noesophagitis are unlikely in view of the site and relationship on occasions to exercise. The \\nlength of the history excludes other causes of acute chest pain, such as pericarditis. Chronic \\nhyperventilation or psychogenic dyspnoea may be detected from a low PaCO\\n2 often with \\ncompensatory low bicarbonate level and an abnormal breathing pattern, often with sighing \\nbreaths. However, it is important to remember that patients with psychogenic dyspnoea may \\ndevelop other medical problems.\\nThe problem of embarking on tests is that there is no simple screening test that can defini -\\ntively rule out significant coronary artery disease. Too many investigations may reinforce her \\nbelief in her illness, and false-positive findings do occur and may exacerbate her anxieties. \\nHowever, if the patient could not be simply reassured, it might be appropriate to proceed with \\nan exercise stress test or a thallium scan to look for areas of reversible ischaemia on exercise \\nor other stress. If this is normal she can then be reassured strongly with confidence.

This would be an important area to be sure about. Of the three \\nagents mentioned, the only one likely to be relevant is paracetamol. Aspirin and temaze -\\npam would be likely to produce more symptoms in less than 14\\n h if t\\nhey have been taken in \\nsignificant quantity. However, the salicylate level should certainly be measured; in this case \\nit was not raised. In the absence of drowsiness at this time, it is not necessary to consider \\ntemazepam any further.\\nParacetamol overdose causes hepatic and renal damage and can lead to death from acute \\nliver failure. The severity of paracetamol poisoning is dose related, with a dose of 15\\n g b\\neing \\nserious in most patients. Patients with pre-existing liver disease and those with a high alco -\\nhol intake may be susceptible to smaller overdoses.\\nThe only significant abnormality on the blood tests is a slightly high prothrombin time and \\nminimally raised AAT. The prothrombin time increase (expressed alternatively as the inter -\\nnational normalized ratio or INR) is a signal that a paracetamol overdose is likely. It is often \\nthe first test to become abnormal when there is liver damage from paracetamol overdose. If \\nthe INR is abnormal at 24\\n h, t\\nhen a significant problem is verylikely. There are few symptoms \\nin the first 24  h except perhaps nausea, vomiting and abdominal discomfort. This may be \\nassociated with tenderness over the liver. The liver function tests usually become abnormal \\nafter the first 24\\n h. Maximum liver damage, as assessed by raised liver enzymes and INR, \\noccurs at days 3–4 after overdose. Acute liver failure may develop between days 3 and 5, and \\nrenal failure occurs in about 25% of patients with severe hepatic damage. Rarely, renal failure \\ncan occur without serious liver damage.\\nThe paracetamol level should be measured urgently; it was found to be high. The evidence of \\nearly liver damage from the INR would in itself suggest that treatment with acetylcysteine \\nwould be appropriate. The earlier this is used the better, but it is certainly still worthwhile 16\\n h \\nafter the ingestion. In this case, a level of paracetamol of 64  mg/L confirmed that treatment \\nwas appropriate, and that the risk of severe liver damage was high. Further advice can always \\nbe obtained by ringing one of the national poison information services. The electrolyte, renal \\nand liver function tests and clotting studies should be monitored carefully over the first few \\ndays and referral to a liver unit considered if there is marked liver dysfunction. Patients with \\nfulminant hepatic failure are considered for urgent liver transplantation.\\nThe other areas that need to be addressed in this case are the mental state and the safety and \\ncare of her son and any other children. This is a serious drug overdose. She should be seen by \\na psychiatrist or other appropriately trained health worker. The question of any possible risk \\nto the baby should be evaluated before she returns home.\\nKey Points\\n•\\tIntravenous acetylcysteine and oral methionine are effective treatments for \\nparacetamol overdose if started early enough.\\n•\\tParacetamol levels can be used to predict problems and guide treatment if the time \\nsince overdose is known.\\n•\\tParacetamol overdose should be suspected in any patient admitted with deranged \\nliver function tests and clotting if no obvious alternative cause is apparent.'),\n",

This is a disorder usually of teenagers or young adults charac -\\nterized by severe weight loss, a disorder of body image (the patients perceiving themselves as \\nfat despite being objectively thin) and amenorrhoea (or, in men, loss of libido or potency). It \\nis commoner in women than men. Often sufferers from this condition work in a profession \\nwhere personal image is very important (e.g. models, actresses, ballet dancers), and there may \\nbe a trigger of an emotional upset such as break-up of a relationship or failure in impor -\\ntant examinations. Patients may abuse purgatives or diuretics or cause self-induced vomiting. \\nSome patients exhibit the bulimic behaviour of recurrent bouts of overeating and self-induced \\nvomiting. Patients often deny that they are ill or that they need medical attention. There is \\nmarked wasting with obvious bony prominences. The skin is dry with growth of lanugo hair \\nover the neck, cheeks and limbs, as in this woman. There is usually sinus bradycardia and \\nhypotension. There may be calluses on the dorsum of the hand (Russell’s sign) due to pres -\\nsure of teeth on the skin whilst inducing vomiting. There is often parotid gland swelling with \\ndiscoloured teeth due to the effect of gastric acid causing loss of dental enamel. Severe physical \\ncomplications include proximal myopathy, cardiomyopathy and peripheral neuropathy.\\n! Major causes of secondary amenorrhoea\\n•\\tHypothalmic/pituitary pathology (e.g. hypopituitarism, hyperprolactinaemia)\\n•\\tGonadal failure (e.g. autoimmune ovarian failure, polycystic ovaries)\\n•\\tUterine damage from previous postpartum haemorrhage or instrumentation.\\n•\\tAdrenal disease (e.g. Cushing’s disease)\\n•\\tThyroid disorders (e.g. both hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism)\\n•\\tSevere chronic illnesses (e.g. cancer, chronic renal failure)\\nA number of interrelated mechanisms cause the metabolic alkalosis in this patient. The vom -\\niting causes a net loss of hydrogen and chloride ions, causing alkalosis and hypochloraemia. \\nThe loss of fluid by vomiting leads to a contracted plasma volume with consequent secondary \\nhyperaldosteronism to conserve sodium and water, but with renal loss of potassium due to its \\nsecretion in preference to sodium and the fact that fewer hydrogen ions are available for secre-\\ntion by the renal tubules. These events combine to give the typical picture of alkalosis with low \\nchloride and raised bicarbonate in the blood; urine containing excess potassium and very little \\nchloride. Measurement of 24\\n h ur\\ninary chloride excretion is helpful. A low urinary chloride \\nexcretion (<10 mm\\nol/day) implies vomiting, whereas higher values suggest diuretic abuse.\\nThis patient should be referred to a unit with a special interest in eating disorders. Other seri-\\nous physical illnesses should be excluded with the appropriate investigations. Plasma levels \\nof luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and oestrogens will be low. \\nOften such patients are admitted for several weeks in an attempt to make them gain weight. \\nThis involves a high-calorie diet with support from the medical and nursing team. Supportive \\npsychotherapy tackles the patient’s disordered perception of personal body image.\\nKey Points\\n•\\tAnorexia nervosa is a common cause of amenorrhoea in young women.\\n•\\tHypokalaemic metabolic alkalosis is the characteristic metabolic abnormality.\\n•\\tAnorexia nervosa may be associated with abuse of diuretics or purgatives.'),\n",

The loss of height is \\ntypical and is usually noted more by others than the patient. The back pain is due to collapse \\nof the vertebrae.

Firstly she is aged 75 years, and age -\\ning is associated with bone loss. Secondly she has been postmenopausal for over 30 years. \\nPremenopausal ovarian production of oestrogens helps to preserve bone mass. Thirdly she \\nhas been on oral and inhaled corticosteroids for her asthma for years. Finally, excess alco -\\nhol intake may also be a factor. Her red cells are macrocytic, which is consistent with heavy \\nalcohol intake. Alcohol can lead to an increased incidence of falls and fractures. She has no \\nclinical evidence of thyrotoxicosis or hypopituitarism, which can cause osteoporosis.\\nThis woman should have blood tests to exclude myeloma, cancer and metabolic bone disease. \\nPatients with myeloma are anaemic with a raised ESR and a monoclonal paraprotein band \\non serum protein electrophoresis. In contrast to metabolic bone diseases biochemical mea -\\nsurements (serum calcium, alkaline phosphatase and parathormone [PTH]) in osteoporosis \\nare normal. She should have plain X-rays of her spine. Collapse of the vertebral body will \\nmanifest as irregular anterior wedging affecting some vertebrae and not others (L1 and L4). \\nA dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) scan can be performed to assess the severity of \\nthe osteoporosis, but treatment is indicated anyway with a fracture at this age.\\nShe should have her dose of corticosteroids reduced to the minimum required to control \\nher asthmatic symptoms, using the inhaled routes as much as possible. Inhaled steroids can \\ncause bruising and systemic effects in prolonged high dose but rarely cause osteoporosis and \\nare considerably safer than oral corticosteroids.She should be started on calcium and vitamin \\nD supplements and a bisphosphonate to try to reduce her bone loss.

This is a very common condition accounting for a large number of referrals to gas -\\ntroenterology clinics. IBS is often episodic, with variable periods of relapse and remission. \\nPeriods of frequent defaecation alternate with periods of relative constipation. Relapses \\nare often associated with periods of stress. In IBS it is common to have a history of other \\nconditions, such as migraine and menstrual irregularity. Under the age of 40 years with a \\nhistory of 6 years of similar problems, it would be reasonable to accept the diagnosis and \\nreassure the patient. However, the family history of carcinoma of the colon raises the pos -\\nsibility of a condition such as familial polyposis coli. The family history, the circumstances \\nof the grandmother’s death and the patient’s feelings about this should be explored fur -\\nther. Anxiety about the family history might contribute to the patient’s own symptoms or \\nher presentation at this time. If there are living family members with polyposis coli, DNA \\nprobing may be used to identify family members at high risk. If any doubt remains in this \\nwoman it would be sensible to proceed to a barium enema or a colonoscopy to rule out any \\nsignificant problems.\\nThe diagnosis of IBS relies on the exclusion of other significant conditions, such as inflamma-\\ntory bowel disease, diverticular disease or large-bowel malignancy. In patients under the age \\nof 40 years it is usually reasonable to do this based on the history, examination and a normal \\nfull blood count and ESR. In older patients, sigmoidoscopy and barium enema or colonoscopy \\nshould be performed. A plan of investigation and management should be clearly established. \\nThe symptoms tend to be persistent and are not helped by repeated normal investigations \\nlooking for an underlying cause. Symptoms may be helped by antispasmodic drugs or tri -\\ncyclic antidepressants. Some patients will benefit from the consumption of a high-fibre diet.\\nKey Points\\n•\\tIrritable bowel syndrome is a common disorder and difficult to treat.\\n•\\tExplanation of the condition to the patient is an important part of the management.\\n•\\tSigmoidoscopy with air insufflation often reproduces the symptoms of IBS.'),\n",

This condition is caused \\nby the protozoan Toxoplasma gondii,  which primarily infects cats but can also be carried \\nby any warm-blooded animal. In the West, 30–80 per cent of adults have been infected by \\ningesting food or water contaminated by cat faeces or by eating raw meat from sheep or pigs \\nthat contained Toxoplasma  cysts. After ingestion by humans the organism divides rapidly \\nwithin macrophages and spreads to muscles and brain. The immune system rapidly controls \\nthe infection, and the cysts remain dormant. The primary infection is generally asymptom -\\natic but can cause an acute mononucleosis-type illness with generalized lympadenopathy \\nand rash. It may leave scars in the choroid and retina and small inflammatory lesions in the \\nbrain. If the host then becomes immunocompromised, the organism starts proliferating, \\ncausing toxoplasmosis. This is an AIDS-defining illness but is relatively rare in solid organ \\ntransplant recipients. Cerebral toxoplasmosis usually presents with a subacute illness com -\\nprising fever; headache; confusion; convulsions; cognitive disturbance; and focal neurologi -\\ncal signs, including hemiparesis, ataxia, cranial nerve lesions, visual field defects and sensory \\nloss. Movement disorders are common due to involvement of the basal ganglia. CT or mag -\\nnetic resonance imaging (MRI) will usually show multiple bilateral ring-enhancing lesions \\npredominantly located near the grey–white matter junction, basal ganglia, brainstem and \\ncerebellum. The clinical and radiological differential diagnoses include lymphoma, tubercu -\\nlosis, Cryptococcus, secondary tumours and bacterial abscesses. Anti-toxoplasma IgG anti -\\nbody is usually but not always positive in patients with toxoplasma encephalitis.\\nThe other clues in this case to the diagnosis of HIV infection include the patient’s country of \\norigin, the weight loss and oral candidiasis. The headaches and papilloedema are caused by \\nraised intracranial pressure from the multiple space-occupying lesions. The hyponatraemia \\nis due to the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (ADH) secretion (SIADH) \\nconsequent to the raised intracranial pressure.\\nThis woman should be started on anticonvulsants to prevent further seizures. Treatment is \\nstarted with high-dose sulfadiazine and pyrimethamine together with folinic acid to prevent \\nmyelosuppression. There should be a rapid clinical and radiological improvement. In cases \\nthat have not responded within 3 weeks, a biopsy of one of the lesions should be considered. \\nCerebral toxoplamosis is uniformly fatal if untreated, and even after treatment neurological \\nsequelae are common.\\nThe patient should be counselled about HIV infection, and consent for an HIV test should \\nbe obtained. Her HIV viral load and CD4 count should be measured and antiretroviral \\ndrugs started. She should be advised to contact her previous sexual partners so that they \\ncan be tested and started on antiretroviral therapy. She should also tell her occupational \\nhealth department so that the appropriate advice can be taken about contacting, testing and \\nreassuring patients. The risk of HIV transmission from an HIV positive healthcare worker to \\na patient is very small.\\nKey Points\\n•\\tToxoplasmosis is the most common opportunistic infection of the central nervous \\nsystem in patients with AIDS.\\n•\\tPatients can present with headache, confusion, seizures and focal neurological deficits.\\n•\\tThe clinical and radiological response to treatment is usually rapid.'),\n",

However, a \\n3 × 4  cm mass of nodes for 2 months is undoubtedly abnormal. Persistent lymphade -\\nnopathy and constitutional symptoms suggest a likely diagnosis of lymphoma or chronic \\nleukaemia. Sarcoidosis and tuberculosis are possible but less likely diagnoses. Lymph \\nnodes are normally barely palpable, if at all. The character of enlarged lymph nodes is \\nvery important. In acute infections the nodes are tender, and the overlying skin may \\nbe red. Carcinomatous nodes are usually very hard, fixed and irregular. The nodes of \\nchronic leukaemias and lymphomas are non-tender, firm and rubbery. The distribution \\nof enlarged lymph nodes may be diagnostic. Repeated minor trauma and infection may \\ncause enlargement of the locally draining lymph nodes. Enlargement of the left supra -\\nclavicular nodes may be due to metastatic spread from bronchial and nasopharyngeal \\ncarcinomas or from gastric carcinomas (Virchow’s node). However, when there is gener -\\nalized lymphadenopathy with or without splenomegaly, a systemic illness is most likely. \\nThe typical systemic symptoms of lymphoma are malaise, fever, night sweats, pruritus, \\nweight loss, anorexia and fatigue. Fever indicates extensive disease and may be associated \\nwith night sweats.

The patient should be referred to \\na local haemato-oncology unit.

CT scanning is a non-invasive and effective method of imaging \\nretroperitoneal, iliac and mesenteric nodes. Positron emission tomography (PET) combined \\nwith CT increases the sensitivity for detecting disease (Figure\\xa035.1) and is useful for assess -\\ning response to treatment.

This would be consistent with the long-standing \\nhistory of abdominal pain of colonic type and tendency to constipation. The recent problems \\nwith increased pain, tenderness, fever, raised white cell count and CRP and a mass in the left  \\niliac fossa would be compatible with an acute exacerbation of her diverticular disease.

In the absence of evidence of perforation with \\nleak of bowel contents into the peritoneum (no peritonitis) or obstruction (normal bowel \\nsounds, no general distension), treatment should be based on the presumptive diagnosis of \\ndiverticulitis.

This most commonly presents with central or \\nepigastric pain which radiates to the back. A posteriorly perforating duodenal ulcer may pro-\\nduce a similar pattern of pain. Nausea, vomiting and fever are common and fluid loss leads \\nto haemodynamic instability and shock. The tachycardia, low blood pressure and haemocon-\\ncentration suggest fluid depletion. On examination there are signs of peritonitis. In severe \\ncases of acute pancreatitis haemorrhage may produce blood staining in the skin of the flanks \\n(Grey–Turner’s sign) or around the umbilicus (Cullen’s sign). Pleural effusions may occur \\nespecially on the left, or pulmonary oedema. The raised white count and high CRP reflect the \\nassociated severe inflammation in acute pancreatitis.\\nThe most common precipitating causes of acute pancreatitis are excessive alcohol use and \\ngallstones together, which account for 75% of cases. Other less common causes are hypercal -\\ncaemia, hyperlipidaemia, abdominal trauma, drugs such as corticosteroids, diuretics, pent -\\namidine, azathioprine, infections such as mumps, coxsackie virus and cytalomegalovirus.\\nDiagnosis is based on the clinical picture and raised levels of serum amylase or lipase. \\nElevations of amylase can occur also in mesenteric ischaemia and other acute abdominal con-\\nditions but an amylase more than 3 times the upper limit of normal with typical clinical fea -\\ntures is diagnostic. Imaging such as CT scan can show inflammation in the pancreas but is not \\nusually necessary. Ultrasound may show underlying biliary tract disease but is less sensitive \\nin the setting of acute pancreatitis. Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) \\ncan also be used in the diagnosis of suspected biliary and pancreatic duct obstruction.\\nVarious staging criteria have been used to grade the severity of acute pancreatitis. The Ransom \\ncriteria are widely used for alcohol induced disease, applied up to 48 hours after onset:\\non admission:\\n•\\t > 55 years\\n•\\t WBC count >16 × 109/L\\n•\\t Blood glucose >10mmol/L\\n•\\t Serum LDH >350 IU /L\\n•\\t AST level >250 IU /L\\nup to 48 hours:\\n•\\t Hematocrit fall >10%\\n•\\t Urea increased >1.8 mm ol/L\\n•\\t Serum calcium <2.0  mm ol/L\\n•\\t PaO2 <8.0 k Pa\\n•\\t Base deficit >4 mE q/L\\n•\\t Estimated fluid sequestration >600  mL\\nW\\nith one point for each item, a score of >2 is predictive of severe pancreatitis and warrants admis-\\nsion to the intensive care unit. Alternative scores such as the Glasgow criteria are often used.\\nManagement is largely related to fluid replacement and analgesia while keeping the patient \\nnil by mouth. There is often considerable fluid loss retro- and intraperitoneally. Antibiotic \\ntreatment is still uncertain and is not generally used routinely.\\nSystemic complications may be related to inflammation and fluid loss, acute respiratory \\ndistress syndrome, multiple organ dysfunction, or pancreatic damage producing diabetes.'),\n",

Her sepsis is due to an anastomotic leak with \\nlocalized peritonitis, which has been partially controlled with antibiotics. Her sepsis syn -\\ndrome is manifested by fever, tachycardia, hypotension, hypoglycaemia, metabolic acidosis \\n(low bicarbonate) and oliguria. The low sodium and high potassium are common in this con-\\ndition as cell membrane function becomes less effective. The elevated white count is a marker \\nfor bacterial infection, and the low platelet count is part of the picture of disseminated intra -\\nvascular coagulation. Jaundice and abnormal liver function tests are common features of \\nintra-abdominal sepsis. Aminoglycosides (gentamicin, streptomycin, amikacin) cause audi -\\ntory and vestibular dysfunction, as well as acute renal failure. Risk factors for aminoglycoside \\nnephrotoxicity are higher doses and duration of treatment, increased age, pre-existing renal \\ninsufficiency, hepatic failure and volume depletion. Aminoglycoside nephrotoxicity usually \\noccurs 7–10 days after starting treatment.

The typical clinical features of the carcinoid syndrome are facial flush -\\ning, abdominal cramps and diarrhoea. Sometimes there is asthma and right-sided heart \\nvalve problems. The symptoms are characteristically intermittent and may come at times of \\nincreased release on activity. Skin changes may be persistent.\\nThe CT scan of the liver shows a space-occupying lesion in the liver likely to represent a \\nmetastasis to the liver.

As a result, she has developed severe \\nischaemic muscle damage, causing release of myoglobin, which is toxic to the kidneys. Other \\ncauses of rhabdomyolysis include crush injuries, severe hypokalaemia, excessive exercise, \\nmyopathies, drugs (e.g. ciclosporin and statins) and certain viral infections. The urine is dark \\nbecause of the presence of myoglobin, which causes a false-positive dipstick test for blood. \\nMyoglobin has a half-life of 2-3 hours much shorter than CK, and so myoglobinuria has often \\ndisappeared whilst the CK is still raised.\\nAcute renal failure due to rhabdomyolysis causes profound hypocalcaemia in the oliguric \\nphase due to calcium sequestration in muscle and reduced 1,25-dihydroxycalciferol levels, \\noften with rebound hypercalcaemia in the recovery phase. This woman’s consciousness level \\nis still depressed as a result of opiate and alcohol toxicity, and she has clinical and radiologi -\\ncal evidence of aspiration pneumonia. She has mixed metabolic and respiratory acidosis (low \\npH, bicarbonate) due to acute renal failure and respiratory depression (pCO\\n2 elevated). Her \\narterial oxygenation is reduced due to hypoventilation and pneumonia. She also has com -\\npartment syndrome in her arm due to massive swelling of her damaged muscles.\\nThis patient has life-threatening hyperkalaemia with electrocardiogram (ECG) changes. The \\nECG changes of hyperkalaemia progress from the earliest signs of peaking of the T-wave, \\nP-wave flattening, prolongation of the PR interval through to widening of the QRS complex, \\na sine-wave pattern and ventricular fibrillation. Emergency treatment involves intravenous \\ncalcium gluconate, which stabilizes cardiac conduction, and intravenous insulin/glucose, \\nintravenous sodium bicarbonate and nebulized salbutamol, all of which temporarily lower \\nthe plasma potassium by increasing the cellular uptake of potassium. However, these steps \\nshould be regarded as holding measures while urgent dialysis is being organized.\\nThe chest X-ray and clinical findings indicate consolidation of the left lower lobe. This patient \\nshould initially be managed on an intensive care unit. She will require antibiotics for her pneu-\\nmonia and will require a naloxone infusion or mechanical ventilation for her respiratory failure. \\nThe patient should have vigorous rehydration with monitoring of her central venous pressure. \\nIf a good urinary flow can be maintained, urinary pH should be kept greater than 7.0 by bicar-\\nbonate infusion, which prevents the renal toxicity of myoglobin.

There are a num -\\nber of factors in the history that could be related to the reason this woman has developed \\ncarpal tunnel syndrome. Rheumatoid arthritis is associated with carpal tunnel syndrome. \\nIt is also more likely in those who use their hands at work or other activities. Her return \\nto work as a secretary could be relevant. Other activities such as painting or other do-it-\\nyourself projects may provoke problems. There is a family history of hypothyroidism which \\nis another association. She is obese (BMI 31.9\\n kg\\n/m2) which may also be involved. The ran -\\ndom blood sugar suggests that she does not have type 2 diabetes as her sisters do, but it \\nwould still be sensible to suggest that she tries to lose weight. Women suffer carpal tunnel \\nsyndrome more than men. The problem may develop during pregnancy possibly related to \\nfluid retention.\\nExamination confirms some sensory problems in the distribution of the median nerve and \\nweakness of abductor pollicis brevis in the thenar eminence, supplied by the median nerve. \\nA careful examination is needed to differentiate carpal tunnel syndrome from other neuro -\\nlogical problems such as T1 lesions and from weakness associated with active arthritis. Other \\ntests which may help to confirm carpal tunnel syndrome are Tinel’s tests where slight percus-\\nsion over the median nerve provokes tingling in the median nerve distribution and Phalen’s \\nmanoeuvre where forced flexion at the wrist for 30–60 seconds exacerbates symptoms by \\nincreasing compression in the carpal tunnel.\\nThe only significant abnormality in the investigations listed is the raised MCV. This might be \\nrelated to hypothyroidism and she certainly needs to have her thyroid stimulating hormone \\n(TSH) levels measured. She is on methotrexate and a raised MCV is common on long-term \\nmethotrexate therapy. It may indicate folic acid deficiency and there is no indication that she \\ntakes folic acid. In addition to TSH she should have measurement of folic acid, vitamin B12 \\nand liver function for investigation of the macrocytosis.\\nThe initial management of her carpal tunnel syndrome is to stop provocative movement tem-\\nporarily and to give her splints to wear at night. This is usually effective in early cases. If the \\nproblems persist then nerve conduction studies will confirm the site and extent of the lesion \\nand local steroid injection or surgical decompression can be considered. In milder cases the \\noutlook is generally good although there may be mild residual tingling.\\nKey Points\\n•\\tCarpal tunnel syndrome often presents with pain at night in the forearm.\\n•\\tPredisposing causes are hypothyroidism, rheumatoid arthritis, diabetes, acromeg -\\naly, obesity and fluid retention as well as repetitive wrist flexion activities and trauma.\\n•\\tMost cases settle without surgical intervention.'),\n",

If doubt remains, \\na barium swallow should show the tendency to reflux, and a gastroscopy would show evi -\\ndence of oesophagitis.

Visual symptoms and \\nvomiting do not occur. The pain is often at its worst in the evening.

Major differential diagnoses of chronic headaches\\n• Classic migraine : characterized by visual symptoms followed within 30 min by the \\nonset of severe hemicranial throbbing, headache, photophobia, nausea and vomit -\\ning lasting for several hours. The onset is usually in early adult life, and a positive \\nfamily history may be present.\\n• Cluster headaches : mainly affect men. The pain is unilateral, usually orbital and \\nsevere in nature. It characteristically occurs 1–2 h after sleeping, lasts 1–2 h, and \\nrecurs nightly for 6–8 weeks.\\n• Headache caused by a space-occupying lesion  (such as tumour or abscess): Often \\nthe headache is initially mild, but over a few weeks becomes severe and is exacer -\\nbated by coughing or sneezing. The headache is usually worse in the morning and \\nis associated with vomiting. There will often be other signs, including personality \\nchange and focal neurological signs.\\n• Miscellaneous causes : sinusitis, dental disorders, cervical spondylosis, glaucoma, \\npost-traumatic headache.\\nIt is important to come to a clear diagnosis and to address the patient’s beliefs and concerns \\nabout the symptoms. In some circumstances it may be necessary to perform a computed \\ntomography (CT) head scan for reassurance.

It \\nis likely that this is a worsening of his pulmonary tuberculosis. This might have occurred \\nbecause he had a resistant organism or, more likely, because he had not taken his treatment \\nas prescribed. Risk factors for development of tuberculosis are poor nutrition, high alcohol \\nintake and immunosuppression (HIV, immunosuppressive therapy). Higher rates occur in \\nthose from the Indian subcontinent and parts of Africa.\\nThe headache and confusion raise the possibility of tuberculous meningitis. Other possibili-\\nties would be liver damage from the antituberculous drugs and the alcohol, although clinical \\njaundice would be expected, or hyponatraemia or hypercalcaemia. If these are not present a \\nlumbar puncture would be indicated if there is no sign to suggest raised intracranial pressure. \\nIt would be advisable to do a computed tomography (CT) scan of the brain first since a fall \\nrelated to his high alcohol consumption might have led to a subdural haemorrhage to give \\nhim his headache and confusion.\\nIt is now 2 months since the initial finding of acid-fast bacilli in the sputum, and the cultures \\nand sensitivities of the organism should be available. These should be checked to be sure that \\nthe organism was Mycobacterium tuberculosis,  and that it was sensitive to the four antituber-\\nculous drugs he was given.

The physical \\nsigns of tachypnoea, tachycardia, raised jugular venous pressure and pleural rub would fit \\nwith a diagnosis of a pulmonary embolus. The peak flow of 410\\n L/\\nmin indicates that asthma \\ndoes not explain her breathlessness.\\nThe differential diagnosis would include pneumonia, pneumothorax and pulmonary \\nembolism. The clinical signs do not suggest pneumothorax or pneumonia. Possible pre -\\ndisposing factors for pulmonary embolism are the history of a long aeroplane journey 3 \\nweeks earlier, oral contraception and her work involving sitting for prolonged periods. \\nOther predisposing factors, such as intravenous drug abuse, should be considered. The \\nECG shows sinus tachycardia. The often-quoted pattern of S-wave in lead I, Q-wave and \\nT inversion in lead III (S1Q3T3) is not common except with massive pulmonary embolus. \\nOther signs, such as transient right ventricular hypertrophy features, P pulmonale and \\nT-wave changes, may also occur. The chest X-ray is normal, ruling out pneumothorax and \\nlobar pneumonia.\\nA ventilation–perfusion lung scan could be done looking for a typical mismatch with an area \\nthat is ventilated but not perfused. This result would have a high probability for a diagno -\\nsis of pulmonary embolism. A pulmonary arteriogram has been the ‘gold standard’ for the \\ndiagnosis of embolism but is a more invasive test. In cases with a normal chest X-ray and no \\nhistory of chronic lung disease, equivocal results are less common, and it is not usually neces-\\nsary to go further than the lung scan. In the presence of chronic lung disease such as chronic \\nobstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or significant asthma, the ventilation–perfusion lung \\nscan is more likely to be equivocal, and further tests are more often used. In this case a com -\\nputed tomography (CT) pulmonary angiogram was carried out (Figure\\xa050.3). This showed a \\nfilling defect typical of an embolus in the right lower lobe pulmonary artery.\\nA search for a source of emboli with a Doppler of the leg veins may help in some cases, and the find-\\ning of negative D-dimers in the blood makes intravascular thrombosis and embolism unlikely.\\nImmediate management should involve heparin, usually as subcutaneous low-molecular-\\nweight heparin. The anticoagulation can then transfer to warfarin, continued in a case like \\nthis for 6 months. Alternative modes of contraception should be discussed and advice given \\non alternating walking or other leg movements with her seated periods at work.

Little history is \\navailable, but the tablets in his pocket might suggest that he has a problem with a painful \\ncondition. There are a number of possible causes for his unconsciousness, including a cere -\\nbrovascular problem; deliberate or accidental drug overdose, including alcohol poisoning; \\nmetabolic or endocrine disturbance; or hypothermia.\\nIf this were an overdose (e.g. of dihydrocodeine), the pupils might well be small. The slow \\nrespiratory rate could be compatible with an opiate excess suppressing ventilation. The oxy -\\ngen saturation results show that he is oxygenating himself satisfactorily, although it would \\nbe sensible to perform blood gases to measure the arterial partial pressure of CO\\n2 (PaCO2). It \\nwould be appropriate to measure the paracetamol level in the blood, and it would be worth \\ngiving the opiate antagonist naloxone if there remained a likelihood of overdose. The blood \\nalcohol level should be measured to exclude alcohol poisoning.\\nMost cerebrovascular problems would be expected to produce some localizing neurological \\nsigns on careful examination, even in an unconscious patient. There are no such signs here. \\nThe absent ankle jerks might be related to his age.\\nHe could have hyperosmolar non-ketotic coma detected by a high glucose and evidence of \\nhaemoconcentration. The blood glucose should be measured together with electrolytes and \\nhaematology, but the single plus sign of glucose in the urine makes it unlikely that he has \\nhyperglycaemic coma. Liver function and renal function should be measured.\\nHe has a slow respiratory rate, low blood pressure and an ECG that shows a wide QRS \\ncomplex. The wide complexes on the ECG show an extra deflection at the end of the QRS \\ncomplex, the J point. This J-wave is characteristic of hypothermia and disappears after \\nrewarming, as shown by the subsequent ECG (Figure\\xa053.2). The pulse rate would often be \\nslower than the 82/min in this man, and the ECG may show evidence of a tremor from shiv -\\nering.

The sudden onset of a headache \\nwithin seconds or a few minutes is characteristic of a subarachnoid haemaorrhage (SAH). In \\ncontrast a migraine usually takes one to two hours to reach maximal intensity. The absence \\nof a similar headache in the past also suggests a new pathology.\\nTension type headaches are the commonest headaches in the general population. The typi -\\ncal presentation is of mild to moderate headache, nonthrobbing, bilateral with no associ -\\nated symptoms. Cluster headaches are characterised by attacks of severe unilateral orbital \\nor temporal pain, accompanied by autonomic features such as nasal congestion, lacrimation \\nand rhinorrhoea. Migraines are often preceded by characteristic symptoms such as flashing \\nlights and are often unilateral. Nausea and photophobia may occur during an attack. Brain \\ntumours cause headaches by causing raised intracranial pressure. The headache is worse after \\ncoughing and is often associated with nausea and vomiting.\\nPatients with SAH often describe the pain as ‘the worst headache in my life’. Fever associ -\\nated with headache suggests an infective cause such as meningitis. A change in conscious \\nlevel or personality suggests an underlying pathology. Rupture of an aneurysm leads to \\nrelease of blood into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) under arterial pressure. The bleeding \\nprobably only lasts for a few seconds, but rebleeding is common. The onset of headache \\nmay be localised to the side of the aneurysm and may be associated with a brief loss of \\nconsciousness, seizure, nausea and vomiting and neck stiffness. A significant minority of \\npatients will have a minor haemorrhage causing a sudden and severe headache (the sentinel \\nheadache) within the 3 weeks leading up to the main SAH. Physical exertion may be a trig -\\nger. Risk factors include smoking, heavy alcohol consumption, uncontrolled hypertension \\nand a family history.\\nOn examination, conscious level may be reduced. There is neck stiffness and there may be \\npreretinal haemorrhages. The key investigation is a noncontrast CT scan. The sensitivity of a \\nhead CT for detecting blood in the CSF is highest in the first 6–12 hours, and then declines \\nrapidly over the next few days. Lumbar puncture is essential if there is a high clinical suspi -\\ncion of a SAH haemorrhage with a normal CT. The usual findings are an elevated opening \\npressure and an elevated red blood cell count that does not decease after the initial few drops. \\nXanthochromia (red/yellow) suggests haemoglobin degradation products and is also sugges -\\ntive of a recent subarachnoid haemorrhage. Once subarachnoid haemorrhage is confirmed \\ndigital subtraction angiography is performed to identify a potential bleeding point for inter -\\nvention. About 15% of patients will not have an aneurysm on angiography.\\nThe main differential diagnoses of a SAH are a sentinel headache, cerebral venous thrombo -\\nsis, acute hypertensive crisis and bacterial or viral meningitis.\\nSAH is associated with a mortality rate of up to 50%. Complications include rebleeding, cere-\\nbral infarction, hydrocephalus, cardiac ischaemia and hypothalamic dysfunction.\\nKey Points\\n•\\tSudden onset of severe headache should trigger investigation to rule out  su barachnoid \\nhaemorrhage.\\n•\\tA sentinel headache often precedes a severe subarachnoid haemorrhage.'),\n",

Arthralgia without deformity in an African-Caribbean man raises \\nthe possibility of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), but this would be much commoner in \\nwomen and would not cause bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy.\\nHe is likely to have had BCG (bacille Calmette–Guèrin) vaccination at school at around the \\nage of 12 years, giving a degree of protection against tuberculosis. A tuberculin test should be \\npositive after BCG, strongly positive in most cases of tuberculosis and negative in 80 per cent \\nof cases of sarcoidosis. The serum level of angiotensin-converting enzyme would be raised \\nin over 80 per cent of cases of sarcoidosis but often in tuberculosis also; the granuloma cells \\nsecrete this enzyme. A computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest will confirm the extent \\nof the lymphadenopathy and show whether there is any involvement of the lung parenchyma. \\nHistology of affected tissue would confirm the clinical diagnosis. This might be obtained by \\na skin biopsy of one of the lesions. A bronchial or transbronchial lung biopsy at fibre-optic \\nbronchoscopy would be another means of obtaining diagnostic histology. In patients with a \\ncough and sarcoidosis, the bronchial mucosa itself often looks abnormal, and biopsy will pro-\\nvide the diagnosis. Lung function tests and electrocardiogram (ECG) should be performed as \\na baseline if the diagnosis is confirmed.\\nSteroid treatment would not be necessary for the hilar lymphadenopathy alone but would be \\nindicated for the hypercalcaemia and possibly for the systemic symptoms.\\nKey Points\\n•\\tSarcoidosis is commoner in those of African-Caribbean heritage.\\n•\\tTypical sites for skin lesions are around the nose and the hairline.\\n•\\tSarcoidosis is a systemic disease and can affect most parts of the body.'),\n",

It is more likely that she has polyuria due to neurogenic diabetes \\ninsipidus as a result of secondary metastases in her hypothalamus. The hypercalcae -\\nmia and raised alkaline phosphatase are suggestive of bony metastases secondary to her \\nbreast carcinoma. The recent-onset headache, worsened by coughing and lying down and \\nassociated with vomiting, is characteristic of raised intracranial pressure, which is con -\\nfirmed by the presence of papilloedema. In some tumours around the pituitary there \\nmay be compression of the optic nerve, causing visual field abnormalities. Neurogenic \\ndiabetes insipidus is due to inadequate arginine vasopressin (AVP, antidiuretic hormone) \\nsecretion. About 30 per cent of cases of neurogenic diabetes insipidus are idiopathic. \\nThe remaining causes are neoplastic; infectious; inflammatory (granulomas); traumatic \\n(neurosurgery, deceleration injury); or vascular (cerebral haemorrhage, infarction). \\nPatients with central diabetes insipidus typically describe an abrupt onset of polyuria \\nand polydipsia.

The principal differential diagnosis \\nis between an epileptic seizure and a syncopal (fainting) attack. Syncope is a sudden loss of \\nconsciousness due to temporary failure of the cerebral circulation. Syncope is distinguished \\nfrom a seizure principally by the circumstances in which the event occurs. For example, \\nsyncope usually occurs while standing, under situations of severe stress or in association \\nwith an arrhythmia. Sometimes a convulsion and urinary incontinence occur. Thus, neither \\nof these is specific for an epileptic attack. The key is to establish the presence or absence of \\nprodromal symptoms. Syncopal episodes are usually preceded by symptoms of dizziness and \\nlight-headedness. Other important neurological syndromes to exclude are transient isch -\\naemic attacks, migraine, narcolepsy and hysterical convulsions. Transient ischaemic attacks \\nare characterized by focal neurological signs and no loss of consciousness unless the verte -\\nbrobasilar territory is affected. The onset of migraine is gradual, and consciousness is rarely \\nlost. In narcolepsy, episodes of uncontrollable sleep may occur, but convulsive movements \\nare absent, and the patient can be wakened.\\nIn this man’s case the episode was witnessed by his wife, who gave a clear history of a grand \\nmal (tonic–clonic) seizure. There may be warning symptoms, such as fear, or an abnormal \\nfeeling referred to some part of the body—often the epigastrium—before consciousness \\nis lost. The muscles become tonically contracted, and the person will fall to the ground. \\nThe tongue may be bitten, and there is usually urinary incontinence. Due to spasm of the \\nrespiratory muscles, breathing ceases, and the subject becomes cyanosed. After this tonic \\nphase, which can last up to a minute, the seizure passes into the clonic or convulsive phase. \\nAfter the contractions end, the patient is stuporous, which lightens through a stage of con -\\nfusion to normal consciousness. There is usually a postseizure headache and generalized \\nmuscular aches.\\nIn adults, idiopathic epilepsy rarely begins after the age of 25 years. Blood tests should be \\nperformed to exclude metabolic causes, such as uraemia, hyponatraemia, hypoglycaemia and \\nhypocalcaemia. Blood alcohol levels and gamma-glutamyltransferase levels should also be \\nmeasured as markers of alcohol abuse. A computed tomography (CT) scan of the brain is \\nneeded to exclude a structural cause such as a brain tumour or cerebrovascular event. This \\nman should be referred to a neurologist for further investigation, including an electroenceph-\\nalogram (EEG).

The score of 3 \\nout of 10 indicates severe impairment of cognitive function. A thirty-point mini-mental state \\nexamination (MMSE) was performed and confirmed severe cognitive impairment. In this \\npatient the diagnosis is dementia , with gradual decline in a number of higher centre cogni -\\ntive domains (language, orientation, calculation, memory).\\nDementia needs to be distinguished from delirium and depression. Dementia is a progressive \\ndecline in mental ability affecting intellect, behaviour and personality. In delirium, patients \\nare acutely confused, inattentive and often have visual hallucinations. Delirium is usually \\nreversible once the underlying cause is addressed (commonly infection, dehydration, med -\\nication and constipation). Patients with dementia are particularly vulnerable to delirium. \\nDepression may mimic dementia (pseudo-dementia), as it can cause severe retardation of \\ncognitive, vocabulary and motor functions. Depressed patients may score poorly on the \\nabbreviated mental state test if they are rushed. Pseudo-dementia from depression is revers -\\nible with anti-depressant therapy.\\nDementia is a syndrome that can be caused by many diseases. The commonest cause of \\ndementia is Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Progressive neuronal damage in AD occurs due to the \\naccumulation of beta amyloid peptide with the formation of amyloid plaques and neurofibril-\\nlary tangles. The cause is not known. AD often begins as subtle forgetfulness and progresses \\nover time such that patients lose their short-term memory, vocabulary, orientation. Later, \\nlong-term memory maybe lost, with an inability to remember relatives’ names or perform \\neveryday tasks. In the latter stages of AD, patients may not attend to personal hygiene, diet or \\nliquid intake. The average time of death from diagnosis is 7 years.\\n!

In the absence of any recent \\nforeign travel, it is most likely that this is an acute episode of ulcerative colitis on top of \\nchronic involvement. The dilated colon suggests a diagnosis of toxic megacolon, which can \\nrupture with potentially fatal consequences. Investigations such as sigmoidoscopy and colo -\\nnoscopy may be dangerous in this acute situation and should be deferred until there has \\nbeen reasonable improvement. The blood results show mild microcytic anaemia, suggesting \\nchronic blood loss, low potassium from diarrhoea (explaining in part her weakness) and \\nraised urea, but normal creatinine, from loss of water and electrolytes.\\nIf the history was just the acute symptoms, then infective causes of diarrhoea would be \\nhigher in the differential diagnosis. Nevertheless, stool should be examined for ova, para -\\nsites and culture. Inflammatory bowel disorders have a familial incidence, but the patient’s \\naunt has an unknown condition, and the relationship is not close enough to be helpful in \\ndiagnosis. Smoking is associated with Crohn’s disease, but ulcerative colitis is more common \\nin non-smokers.\\nAlthough amoxicillin treatment can be associated with bowel disturbance or even Clostridium \\ndifficile infection but it is not relevant here since the diarrhoea was present before taking \\namoxicillin and did not change afterwards.\\nShe should be treated immediately with corticosteroids and intravenous fluid replacement, \\nincluding potassium. If the colon is increasing in size or is initially larger than 5.5 cm in \\ndiameter, then a laparotomy should be considered to remove the colon to prevent perforation. \\nIf not, the steroids should be continued until the symptoms resolve, and diagnostic proce -\\ndures such as colonoscopy and biopsy can be carried out safely. Sulphasalazine or mesalazine \\nare used in the chronic maintenance treatment of ulcerative colitis after resolution of the \\nacute attack.\\nIn this case, the colon steadily enlarged despite fluid replacement and other appropriate treat-\\nment. She required surgery with a total colectomy and ileorectal anastomosis. The histology \\nconfirmed ulcerative colitis. The ileorectal anastomosis will be reviewed regularly; there is an \\nincreased risk of rectal carcinoma.\\nKey Points\\n•\\tBloody diarrhoea implies serious colonic pathology.\\n•\\tIt is important to monitor colonic dilatation carefully in colitis, and vital to operate \\nbefore rupture.\\n•\\tBoth Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis can cause a similar picture of active \\ncolitis.'),\n",

Rate control aims to keep the heart rate under 100 beats per \\nminute without the restoration of sinus rhythm. In general, a rate control strategy is used in \\nolder patients with longstanding and usually asymptomatic AF. A rhythm control strategy \\naims to restore and maintain sinus rhythm and is used in younger patients who have recent \\nonset AF and experience symptoms. Restoring sinus rhythm can be achieved using medica -\\ntion (for example, amiodarone, sotalol, flecainide), elective DC cardioversion or by surgery. \\nSurgery includes AV nodal ablation, pacing or pulmonary vein ablation.\\nIn this patient, rate control was achieved with a calcium channel blocker, as a beta-blocker \\nwas contraindicated due to his asthma. Although his CHADS-2 score was two, warfarin was \\nnot recommended because of his history of alcohol misuse and poor medication adherence. \\nAspirin was prescribed to reduce his thrombo-embolic risk. A proton pump inhibitor was \\nprescribed with the aspirin to prevent aspirin-induced peptic ulcer disease.\\nKey Points\\n•\\tAF is often asymptomatic.\\n•\\tAF is a risk factor for stroke.

Typically aortic stenosis produces a murmur loud -\\nest in the aortic area that radiates to the carotid arteries. Its character is ejection systolic or \\ncrescendo-decrescendo. Left-side murmurs typically get louder with expiration as positive \\nintrathoracic pressures increase the pressure difference across the valve (left-side murmurs \\nloudest with expiration, r ight-side murmurs loudest with inspiration). The electrocardio -\\ngram shows left ventricular hypertrophy, which is a feature of aortic stenosis. Narrowing \\nof the aortic valve causes left ventricular outflow obstruction. The left ventricle attempts to \\nmaintain cardiac output and hypertrophies in a response to an increased transvalvular pres -\\nsure gradient created by the valve stenosis. Electrocardiograph and chest radiograph may \\nshow evidence of left ventricular hypertrophy. Causes of aortic stenosis include a congenitally \\nabnormal valve with superimposed calcification, calcific disease of a previously normal aor -\\ntic valve and rheumatic valve disease.\\nThe presence of symptoms usually indicates the aortic stenosis is severe. Symptoms include \\nexertional dyspnoea, fatigue, dizziness and chest pain. Approximately half of patients with \\naortic stenosis who present with chest pain have co-existing coronary artery disease. Signs \\nof severe aortic stenosis include plateau pulse, an aortic thrill, length and lateness of the peak \\nof the systolic murmur, 4th heart sound, paradoxical splitting of S2, absent A2 and signs of \\nheart failure. An echocardiogram should be performed to assess the severity of the stenosis. \\nEchocardiographic features of severe aortic stenosis include a valve area less than 1 cm\\n2 (nor-\\nmal 3–4 cm 2), jet velocity over 4 m/s (normal <2.5m/sec) and a mean transvalvular pressure \\ngradient exceeding 40 mmHg.\\nAortic stenosis tends to progress over time and patients should be monitored with regular \\nechocardiograms. The frequency of echocardiogram varies depending on the severity of AS; \\nevery 3 to 5 years for mild disease, 1 to 2 years for moderate disease and yearly for severe dis-\\nease. Antibiotics before a dental or invasive procedure to prevent bacterial endocarditis are \\nno longer recommended for patients with aortic stenosis. Patients with symptomatic and/or \\nsevere aortic stenosis should be referred to a cardiothoracic unit for aortic valve replacement. \\nIf valve replacement is not performed, the life expectancy is usually 2–3 years after the devel -\\nopment of symptoms. This patient underwent an aortic valve replacement with resolution of \\nhis symptoms.\\nKey Points\\n•\\tThe development of symptoms in patients with aortic stenosis is an indication for \\naortic valve replacement.\\n•\\tAortic stenosis progresses over time and patients should be monitored with regular \\nechocardiograms.'),\n",

This is a common \\nproblem in patients on long-term steroids and arises when there is a need for increased glu -\\ncocorticoid output, most frequently seen in infections or trauma, including surgery, or when \\nthe patient has prolonged vomiting and therefore cannot take the oral steroid effectively. It \\npresents as here with drowsiness and low blood pressure.\\nThe hyponatraemia is another result of the superimposed illness. It is probably due to a com-\\nbination of reduced intake of sodium owing to the anorexia and dilution of plasma by the fluid \\nintake. In secondary hypoaldosteronism the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system is intact \\nand should operate to retain sodium. This is in contrast to acute primary hypoaldosteronism \\n(Addisonian crisis), when the mineralocorticoid secretion fails as well as the glucocorticoid \\nsecretion, causing hyponatraemia and hyperkalaemia. Acute secondary hypoaldosteronism \\nis often, but erroneously, called an Addisonian crisis.\\nSpread of the infection should also be considered, the prime sites being to the brain, with \\neither meningitis or cerebral abscess, or locally to cause a pulmonary abscess or empyema. \\nThe patient has a degree of immunosuppression due to her age and the long-term steroid use. \\nThe dose of steroid is higher than may appear at first sight as the patient is only 50\\n kg\\n; drug \\ndoses are usually denoted for a 70-kg male, which in this case would equate to 10 mg \\nof pred-\\nnisolone, that is, an increase of 40 per cent on her dose of 7  mg\\n.\\nThe treatment is immediate empirical intravenous infusion of hydrocortisone and saline.

Optic neuritis is associated with recur-\\nrence and progression to further demyelinating problems in about 50% of cases (greater in \\nwomen than men).\\nThe combination of these two problems indicates two neurological problems separated in \\nspace and time, in typical sites for demyelination and suggesting a likely underlying diagno -\\nsis of multiple sclerosis.\\nFurther investigations should be magnetic resonance imaging to look for evidence of patchy \\ndemyelination. Abnormalities are found in the brain in over 90% of patients and in the spinal \\ncord in about 75%. Oedema is shown on T2-weighted images and cerebral atrophy and areas \\nof axonal death on T1 images.

There is a suggestion of a bullous lesion at \\nthe apex of the right lung. Pneumothoraces are usually visible on normal inspiratory films, \\nbut an expiratory film may help when there is doubt. There is no mediastinal displacement \\non examination or X-ray; movement of the mediastinum away from the side of the pneumo -\\nthorax would suggest a tension pneumothorax. Although she had symptoms initially, these \\nhave settled down as might be expected in a fit patient with no underlying lung disease. A \\nrim of air greater than 2 cm around the lung on the X-ray indicates at least a moderate pneu-\\nmothorax because of the three-dimensional structure of the lung within the thoracic cage \\nrepresented on the two-dimensional X-ray.\\nThe differential diagnosis of chest pain in a young woman includes pneumonia and pleurisy, \\npulmonary embolism and musculoskeletal problems. However, the clinical signs and X-ray \\nleave no doubt about the diagnosis in this woman. Pneumothoraces are more common in \\ntall, thin men; in smokers; and in those with underlying lung disease. Further investigations \\nsuch as computed tomography (CT) scan are not indicated unless there is a suggestion of \\nunderlying lung disease.\\nThere is a suggestion that she may have had a similar episode in the past, but it may have been \\non the left side. There is a tendency for recurrence of pneumothoraces, about 20 per cent after \\none event and 50 per cent after two. Because of this, pleurodesis should be considered after \\ntwo pneumothoraces or for those whose occupations might be affected, such as professional \\ndivers or pilots.\\nThe immediate management is to aspirate the pneumothorax through the second intercos -\\ntal space anteriorly using a cannula of 16-French gauge or more, at least 3 cm long. Small \\npneumothoraces with no symptoms and no underlying lung disease can be left to absorb \\nspontaneously, but this is quite a slow process. Up to 2500\\n mL c\\nan be aspirated at one time, \\nstopping if it becomes difficult to aspirate or the patient coughs excessively. If the aspiration is \\nunsuccessful or the pneumothorax recurs immediately, intercostal drainage to an underwa -\\nter seal or valve may be indicated. Difficulties at this stage or a persistent air leak may require \\nthoracic surgical intervention. This is considered earlier than it used to be since the adoption \\nof less-invasive video-assisted techniques has become widespread. In this woman the apical \\nbulla was associated with a persistent leak and required surgical intervention through video-\\nassisted minimally invasive surgery.\\nShe should be offered support to stop smoking since tobacco smoking increases the risk of \\nrecurrence of pneumothorax. Marijuana has been reported to be associated with bullous \\nlung disease, and this patient should be advised to avoid it.\\nKey Points\\n•\\tThe patient should not be allowed to fly for at least 1 week after the pneumothorax \\nhas resolved with full expansion of the lung (2 weeks after a traumatic pneumothorax).\\n•\\tThe risk of recurrence will be reduced by stopping smoking.'),\n",

The four key features that characterise dementia are dis -\\nturbance of consciousness, no obvious preexisting dementia, confusion that develops \\nacutely (over hours or days) and tends to fluctuate during the day, and evidence of a \\nprecipitating cause such as a serious medical condition, substance abuse or medication \\nside effect.\\nIn contrast the cognitive changes in Alzheimer’s disease are insidious, progressive and occur \\nover a much longer time frame.\\nCommon causes of delirium are fluid and electrolyte disturbances, infections, drug or alco -\\nhol toxicity, withdrawal from alcohol and drugs, metabolic disorders (hypoglycaemia, hyper-\\ncalcaemia, liver failure), low perfusion states (shock, heart failure) and postoperative states.\\nIn this case, there is no record of any drugs except thyroxine, although this should be \\nrechecked to rule out any analgesics or other agents that he might have had access to or that \\nmight not be regarded as important. The thyroid abnormality is not likely to be relevant. \\nThe lack of replacement for 2 days will not have a significant effect and the normal results 6 \\nmonths earlier make this an unlikely cause of his current problem. The sugar is normal. The \\nfalls raise the possibility of trauma, and a subdural haematoma could present in this way. \\nHowever, it seems that the falls were a secondary phenomenon. The most likely cause is that \\nhe has a urinary tract infection. There is blood and protein in the urine, he has become incon-\\ntinent and he has some tenderness in the loin which could fit with pyelonephritis. We are not \\ntold whether he had a fever, and the white cell count should be measured.\\nIf this does seem the likely diagnosis it would be best to treat him where he is if this is safe \\nand possible. He is likely to be more confused by a move to a new environment in hospital. \\nThere is every likelihood that he will return to his previous state if the urinary tract infec -\\ntion is confirmed and treated appropriately, although this may take longer than the response \\nin temperature and white cell count. Treatment should be started on the presumption of a \\nurinary tract infection while the diagnosis is confirmed by microscopy and culture of the \\nurine. The most likely organism is Escherichia coli , and an antibiotic such as trimethoprim \\nwould be appropriate, although resistance is possible, and advice of the local microbiologist \\nmay be helpful. From the confusion point of view he should be treated calmly, consistently \\nand without confrontation. If medication is necessary, small doses of a neuroleptic such as \\nhaloperidol or olanzapine would be appropriate.\\nKey Points\\n•\\tAcute changes in mental state need to be explained even in the elderly with base -\\nline mental problems.\\n•\\tIn delirium, consciousness is clouded, disorientation is usual, and delusions may \\ndevelop.

The first part of the \\ncare should be to ensure that he is stable from a cardiac and respiratory point of view. His \\nrespiratory rate is a little high. Blood gases should be measured to monitor oxygenation and \\nensure that the carbon dioxide level is not high, suggesting hypoventilation.\\nThe family history of diabetes raises the possibility that his problem is related to this. However, \\nthe speed of onset makes hyperglycaemic coma unlikely. One would expect a slower develop-\\nment with a history of thirst and polyuria over the last day or so. However, the blood sugar \\nshould certainly be checked. Hypoglycaemia comes on faster but would not occur as a new \\nevent in diabetes mellitus. It might occur as a manifestation of a rare condition such as an \\ninsulinoma. Other metabolic causes of coma, such as abnormal levels of sodium or calcium, \\nshould be checked.\\nA neurological problem such as a subarachnoid haemorrhage is possible as a sudden unex -\\npected event in a young person. Where the level of consciousness is so affected, some local -\\nizing signs or subhyaloid haemorrhage in the fundi might be expected. If no other cause \\nis evident from the initial investigations, a computed tomography (CT) scan might be \\nindicated.\\nThe most likely cause is that the loss of consciousness is drug related. Despite the lack of any \\nwarning of intent beforehand, drug overdose is common, and the question of availability \\nof any medication should be explored further. This would be likely to be a sedative drug. If \\nthere is any suspicion of this, then levels of other drugs that might need treatment should be \\nmeasured (e.g. aspirin and paracetamol).\\nThe other possibility in somebody brought in unconscious is that they are suffering from car-\\nbon monoxide poisoning. The fact that it is winter and he was found in the bathroom where \\na faulty gas-fired heater might be situated increases this possibility. Patients with carbon \\nmonoxide poisoning are usually pale rather than the traditional cherry-red colour associated \\nwith carboxyhaemoglobin. Papilloedema can occur in severe carbon monoxide poisoning \\nand might account for the swollen appearance of the optic discs on funduscopy.\\nMeasurement of carboxyhaemoglobin showed a level of 32 per cent. He was treated with high \\nlevels of inspired oxygen and made a slow but full recovery over the next 48\\n h. M\\nannitol for \\ncerebral oedema and hyperbaric oxygen are considerations in the management. The problem \\nwas traced to a faulty gas water heater that had not been serviced for 4 years.\\nKey Points\\n•\\tDrug overdose is the commonest cause of unconsciousness in young people, but \\nother diagnoses must always be considered.\\n•\\tCarboxyhaemoglobin levels should be measured in patients found unconscious \\nindoors or in vehicles and after known exposure to smoke.\\n•\\tIn carbon monoxide poisoning, marked hypoxia may be present in the absence \\nof cyanosis.'),\n",

He has presented with sudden onset of severe headache, \\nvomiting, confusion, photophobia and neck stiffness. The presence of hypotension, leucocy -\\ntosis and renal impairment suggests acute bacterial infection rather than viral meningitis. \\nThe most likely causative bacteria are Neisseria meningitidis , Haemophilus influenzae and \\nStreptococcus pneumonia . In patients in this age group Streptococcus pneumonia or  Neisseria \\nmeningitidis are the most likely organisms. Meningococcal meningitis ( Neisseria meningiti -\\ndis) is usually associated with a generalized vasculitic rash.\\nThe most severe headaches are experienced in meningitis, subarachnoid haemorrhage and \\nclassic migraine. Meningitis and subarachnoid haemorrhage present as single episodes of \\nheadaches. Meningitis usually presents over hours, whereas subarachnoid haemorrhage usu -\\nally presents suddenly. Fundoscopy in patients with subarachnoid haemorrhage may show \\nsubhyaloid haemorrhage. Meningeal irritation can be seen in many acute febrile conditions, \\nparticularly in children. Local infections of the neck/spine may cause neck stiffness. Other \\nmeningitis types include viral, fungal, cryptococcal and tuberculous meningitis, which can \\nbe distinguished by analysis of the CSF.\\nWhen meningitis is suspected appropriate antibiotic treatment should be started even before \\nthe diagnosis is confirmed. In the absence of a history of significant penicillin allergy, the \\nmost common treatment would be intravenous ceftriaxone or cefotaxime.\\nPatients with no papilloedema or lateralizing neurological signs that suggest a space-occu -\\npying lesion should be lumbar punctured immediately (even before a CT scan is obtained). \\nIf there are localized neurological signs it is essential to perform a CT scan first to avoid the \\ndangers of coning, which can occur when a lumbar puncture is performed in the presence of \\nraised intracranial pressure.\\nThe combination of >1000 neutrophils/mL CSF, a CSF glucose <40 per cent of the simultane-\\nous blood level and a CSF protein of 1.4\\n g/\\nL is strongly suggestive of bacterial meningitis. The \\nGram stain and culture will give the definitive diagnosis. In this case, the Gram stain demon-\\nstrated Gram-positive cocci consistent with Streptococcus pneumonia infection. Intravenous \\nantibiotics must be started immediately. The patient must be nursed in a manner appropriate \\nfor the decreased consciousness level. Adequate analgesia with opiates should be given. The \\npatient has mild hyponatraemia due to the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone \\n(ADH) secretion, and fluid losses should be treated with normal saline. Inotropes may be \\nneeded to treat hypotension.\\nThe two children aged 3 and 4 years must be considered. It is not clear from the history who is \\nlooking after them. They should be examined, and if meningococcal meningitis is suspected \\nor the organism is uncertain, they should be given prophylactic treatment with rifampicin \\nand vaccinated against meningococcal meningitis.\\nKey Points\\n•\\tBacterial meningitis causes severe headache, neck stiffness, drowsiness and \\nphotophobia.\\n•\\tThe main differential diagnoses are subarachnoid haemorrhage and migraine.\\n•\\tWhen bacterial meningitis is strongly suspected, antibiotic treatment should be \\nstarted before bacteriological confirmation is available.'),\n",

Her current \\npain has lasted longer than previous episodes, and on examination she is jaundiced. \\nThe acute pain on inspiration while palpating in the right upper quadrant is a positive \\nMurphy’s sign of inflammation of the gallbladder. The relative bradycardia in the pres -\\nence of the acute illness is likely to be related to the beta-blocker therapy (atenolol) rather \\nthan hypothyroidism or any other problem. The dark urine would fit with increased \\nconjugated bilirubin because of obstruction. The conjugated bilirubin is water soluble \\nand excreted in the urine. Without conjugated bilirubin entering the bowel, one would \\nexpect pale stools.\\nHer investigations show a raised bilirubin. The alanine aminotransferase is slightly raised, but \\nthe main abnormalities in the liver enzymes are high values of alkaline phosphatase and gamma-\\nglutamyl transpeptidase. This is the pattern of obstructive jaundice, which can be caused by \\nmechanical obstruction by tumour or by gallstones or by adverse effects of some drugs (e.g. \\nphenothiazines, flucloxacillin). The drugs she is taking are not likely causes of liver problems.\\nThe previous episodes of pain and fever over the last 5 years are likely to have been chole -\\ncystitis secondary to gallstones. If the gallbladder were to be palpable on examination, this \\nwould suggest an alternative diagnosis of malignant obstruction since by this time these \\nprevious episodes of cholecystitis would usually have caused scarring and contraction of the \\ngallbladder. To produce obstructive jaundice one or more of her gallstones must have moved \\nout of the gallbladder and impacted in the common bile duct. Migration of gallstones from \\nthe gallbladder occurs in around 15 per cent of cases.\\nHer thyroid condition seems to be stable and not relevant to the current problem. Her angina \\nis indicative of coronary artery disease and needs to be considered when treatment is being \\nplanned for her gallstones. An electrocardiogram (ECG) should be part of her management.\\nOnly a minority of gallstones are radiopaque and visible on a plain radiograph, so the next \\ninvestigation should be an ultrasound of the liver and biliary tract.

Despite adequate sleep opportunity (>7 hours) this patient describes excessive daytime \\nsleepiness. This patient has symptoms of OSA with snoring, nocturnal dyspnea, witnessed \\napnoea and daytime sleepiness. Other symptoms of sleep apnoea include fatigue, poor con -\\ncentration, nocturia, nocturnal choking, sore throat and morning headache. OSA is due to \\nepisodic collapse of the lumen of the upper airway during sleep. It results in airflow obstruc -\\ntion, oxygen desaturation and arousals from sleep. The frequent arousals from sleep result in \\ndaytime somnolence. Sleep apnoea causes hypertension and is a common cause of resistant \\nhypertension. It is also an independent risk factor for heart disease and stroke. Patients may \\nnot be aware they have sleep apnoea and present with daytime sleepiness.\\nSleep studies are required to confirm OSA. In this case, an overnight oximetry shows recur -\\nrent oxygen desaturations and heart rate rises consistent with OSA. Overnight oximetry is \\na useful tool; however, more detailed testing, such as an inpatient polysomnography, may be \\nrequired if overnight oximetry is not diagnostic.\\nThe treatment of sleep apnoea includes weight loss, mandibular advancement splints (MAS), \\nand continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP). Tonsillectomy can be performed if tonsils \\nare very enlarged, and is the commonest treatment of sleep apnoea in children.\\nCPAP is a device that provides positive airway pressure through a facemask. The positive \\npressure splints the upper airway open and prevents it from collapsing during sleep. CPAP \\nis recommended for the treatment of moderate and severe OSA. Mandibular advancement \\nsplints are used in mild sleep apnoea. These are gum shields worn at night that pull the lower \\njaw forward and open the lumen of airway.\\nObesity is a major reversible risk factor for OSA. The increasing prevalence of obesity world -\\nwide has been accompanied by an increase in OSA. Weight loss should be recommended for \\nall patients with OSA who are overweight (BMI ≥25\\n kg\\n/m2). Dietary advice, behaviour modi-\\nfication and regular exercise should be recommended. Medication such as orlistat, which \\ninhibits intestinal fat absorption, can also be also used. Bariatric surgery has a high success \\nrate of weight loss and resolution of OSA. Bariatric surgery should be considered in patients \\nwith a BMI ≥40\\n kg\\n/m2 or BMI of 35 to 40 kg /m2 with a co-morbid condition (such as diabetes \\nmellitus, OSA or hypertension).\\nIn most countries OSA is a notifiable condition to the driving authorities. In the UK this \\npatient should not drive until treatment has started and sleepiness has resolved.\\nKey Points\\n•\\tThere is an increasing prevalence of obesity and OSA worldwide due to obesity.\\n•\\tOSA presents with excessive daytime sleepiness and is a common cause of resistant \\nhypertension.\\n•\\tTreatment of OSA is usually with CPAP and weight loss.'),\n",

The \\nsystemic symptoms, white cell count and inflammatory markers all indicate that there is a \\ncurrent problem with infection. The chest X-ray and the clinical findings show that there \\nis a left pleural effusion. Pleural effusions can occur in association with pneumonia when \\nthey may be ‘sympathetic’ effusions related to the inflammation at the pleural surface of the \\nlung. Such effusions resolve without further treatment as the pneumonia is treated. However, \\nin this man it is more likely that the effusion is infected, i.e. an empyema. This needs to be \\nestablished by aspiration of a sample of the fluid. This is best done under ultrasound guid -\\nance to reduce the likelihood of complications from the needle aspiration. This will also \\nshow whether there is one collection or loculation of the fluid as may occur with the intense \\ninflammation associated with infection in the pleural space.\\nEmpyemas are more likely to develop when there is inadequate antibiotic treatment or under-\\nlying problems with immunity. In this case antibiotics were discontinued too soon and his \\npoor nutrition and high alcohol intake increase susceptibility.\\nIn this case an ultrasound suggested some adhesions within the space but no distinct \\nloculation. When a needle was inserted into the space, pus was aspirated. The pus had an \\noverwhelmingly bad smell which permeated the side ward immediately. In this case it was \\nobvious that the fluid was infected and the smell suggests that this is an anaerobic infection \\nmost commonly seen with the organism Streptococcus milleri . When the fluid is not obvi -\\nously infected it should be sent for estimation of pH, protein, glucose and culture alongside \\na simultaneous blood glucose test. A pH <7.20 and low glucose are suggestive of infection in \\nthe pleural fluid.\\nAs with any significant collection of pus empyemas require physical drainage as well as anti -\\nbiotics. An adequate sized drain should be inserted, best placed under radiological control.

The \\nabdominal pains would be consistent with those from a peptic ulcer, especially a duodenal \\nulcer when there is more often some relief from food. The diagnosis should be established \\nby endoscopy because alternative diagnoses such as carcinoma of the stomach cannot be \\nruled out from the history. The site of the blood loss causing the iron deficiency should be \\nestablished.

For small (<1cm) uncompli -\\ncated ulcers there is no indication for continuing proton pump inhibitors after completion \\nof the course of antibiotics. By contrast, continuing antisecretory therapy until the cure of \\nH. pylori is confirmed is important for complicated ulcers.

She \\nis at increased risk of cerebrovascular disease because of her smoking, hypertension and dia -\\nbetes. She is describing recurrent transient ischaemic attacks (TIAs), which by definition \\nresolve completely in less than 24\\n h and, in practice, often much quicker. Two months before \\nher admission she had an episode of amaurosis fugax (transient uniocular blindness) which \\nis often described as like a shutter coming down over the visual field of one eye. The TIAs \\nare affecting the left cerebral hemisphere in the area of brain supplied by the left carotid \\nartery, causing right-sided weakness and dysarthria. TIAs may be caused by thromboembo -\\nlism from ulcerated plaques in the carotid arteries or aortic arch, from cardiac sources such \\nas a dilated left atrium, and more rarely due to haematological causes such as polycythaemia \\nrubra vera, sickle cell disease or hyperviscosity due to myeloma. The symptoms may be the \\nsame each time or vary. Her ECG shows atrial fibrillation, and she has the signs of mitral \\nregurgitation with a pansystolic murmur and displaced apex beat. There are three obvious \\npotential sources for emboli:\\n•\\t a left carotid artery stenosis (in a correct location to account for the distribution of \\nthese TIAs and more likely in the presence of a carotid bruit)\\n•\\t the left atrium in atrial fibrillation with clinically evident mitral regurgitation\\n•\\t a previous myocardial infarction with mural thrombosis.\\n! Major causes of transient neurological syndromes\\n• Migraine: the aura of migraine is a spreading and slowly intensifying phenom -\\nenon, and the symptoms are usually positive (e.g. scotomata). The aura is usually \\nfollowed by a severe headache. However, migraines can be associated with focal \\nneurological deficits (e.g. hemiplegia).\\n• Focal epilepsy: this also normally causes positive symptoms such as twitching and \\nsensory symptoms, which may march up one limb and from one limb to another \\non the same side.\\n• Syncope: unlike most TIAs there is loss of consciousness, but there are usually no \\nfocal signs. Dizziness often precedes the attack.\\n• Space-occupying lesion : a cerebral tumour or abscess can produce fluctuating \\nsymptoms and signs. The symptoms are usually more gradual in onset and are \\noften associated with headaches or personality changes.\\n• Miscellaneous : hysteria, cervical spondylosis, hypoglycaemia and cataplexy.\\nThis patient should be investigated with computed tomography (CT) of the head to exclude \\na structural space-occupying lesion; echocardiography to assess left-atrial size, the mitral \\nvalve (to exclude infective valvular vegetations) and to rule out thrombus in the left ventricle \\nrelated to the previous infarct; and a Doppler ultrasound of the carotid arteries. If a critical \\ncarotid stenosis (>70 per cent) is present, carotid endarterectomy should be considered. The \\npatient should be anticoagulated with warfarin because of her atrial fibrillation and carotid \\nstenosis. Her blood pressure and diabetes should be carefully controlled and her lipids mea -\\nsured and treated if appropriate.'),\n",

Some more information \\nin the history about the circumstances of these falls would be helpful. On further enquiry, \\nit emerges that the falls are most likely to occur when he gets up from bed first thing in \\nthe morning. The afternoon events have occurred on getting up from a chair after his post -\\nlunch doze. These circumstances suggest a possible diagnosis of postural hypotension. This \\nwas verified by measurements of standing and lying blood pressure—the diagnostic criteria \\nare a drop of 15\\n mm\\nHg on standing for 3 min. This showed a marked postural drop, with \\nblood pressure decreasing from 134/84 to 104/68  mm\\nHg. This is most likely to be caused by \\nthe antihypertensive treatment; both the alpha-blocker, which causes vasodilation, and the \\ndiuretic might contribute. Another possible candidate for a cause of the postural hypoten -\\nsion is the diabetes, which could be associated with autonomic neuropathy. In this case the \\ndiabetes is not known to have been present for long, and there is evidence of only very mild \\nperipheral sensory neuropathy. Diabetic autonomic neuropathy is usually associated with \\nquite severe peripheral sensory neuropathy, with or without motor neuropathy.\\nThe electrocardiogram (ECG) shows evidence of sinoatrial node disease or sick sinus syn -\\ndrome. Clinically, it is easily mistaken for atrial fibrillation because of the irregular rhythm \\nand the variation in strength of beats. The ECG shows a P-wave with each QRS complex, \\nalthough the P-waves change in shape and timing. It may be associated with episodes of \\nbradycardia or tachycardia, which could cause falls. This might be investigated further with \\na 24-h ambulatory recording of the ECG.\\nCoughing bouts can cause falls through cough syncope. The positive intrathoracic pressure \\nduring coughing limits venous return to the heart. The cough is usually quite marked, and \\nhe might be expected to remember this since he gives a good account of the falls otherwise. \\nSyncope can occur in association with micturition. Neck movements with vertebrobasilar dis-\\nease, poor eyesight and problems with balance are other common causes of falls in the elderly. A \\nneurological cause, such as transient ischaemic episodes and epilepsy, is less likely with the lack \\nof prior symptoms and the swift recovery with clear consciousness and no neurological signs.\\nAnother diagnosis that should be remembered in older people who fall is a subdural haema -\\ntoma. Symptoms may fluctuate, and this might be considered and ruled out with a computed \\ntomography (CT) scan of the brain.\\nThe doxazosin should be stopped and another antihypertensive agent started if necessary. \\nThis might be a beta-blocker, long-acting calcium antagonist or angiotensin converting-\\nenzyme (ACE) inhibitor, although all these can cause postural drops in blood pressure. \\nHis symptoms all disappeared on withdrawal of the doxazosin. The blood pressure rose to \\n144/86\\n mm\\nHg lying and 142/84 mm\\nHg standing, indicating no significant postural hypoten -\\nsion, with reasonable blood pressure control.\\nKey Points\\n•\\tFalls in the elderly are a symptom in need of a diagnosis.\\n•\\tPostural hypotension is a common side effect of diuretics, vasodilators or other \\n an\\ntihypertensive therapy. Lying and standing blood pressures should be measured \\nif this is suspected.\\n•\\tAutonomic neuropathy in diabetes is associated with significant peripheral \\n s\\nensory neuropathy..'),\n",

He is acidotic. The blood glucose level is not given, but the picture is likely to \\nrepresent hyperglycaemic ketoacidotic coma . The key clinical features on examination are \\ndehydration shown by skin signs and significant postural hypotension and hyperventilation \\nsecondary to a metabolic acidosis, and the triggering problem with the infection in the foot. \\nA persistently high glucose level induced by the response to an infected foot ulcer causes \\nheavy glycosuria, triggering an osmotic diuresis. This leads to hypovolaemia and reduced \\nrenal blood flow, causing prerenal uraemia. The extracellular hyperosmolality causes severe \\ncellular dehydration, and loss of water from his brain cells is the cause of his coma. Decreased \\ninsulin activity with intracellular glucose deficiency stimulates lipolysis and the production \\nof ketoacids. He has a high anion gap metabolic acidosis due to accumulation of ketoac -\\nids (acetoacetate and 3-hydroxybutyrate). The anion gap is calculated from the following \\nequation:\\n[Na\\n+] + [K+] − ([Cl−] + [HCO3\\n−])\\nand is normally 10–18 mmol/L; in this case it is 31.5  mm\\nol/L. Ketones cause a characteristi -\\ncally sickly sweet smell on the breath of patients with diabetic ketoacidosis (about 20 per cent \\nof the population cannot smell the ketones). The metabolic acidosis stimulates the respira -\\ntory centre, leading to an increase in the rate and depth of respiration (Kussmaul breathing) \\nand producing the reduction in PaCO\\n2 as respiratory compensation for the acidosis. In older \\ndiabetic patients there is often evidence of infection (e.g. bronchopneumonia, infected foot \\nulcer) precipitating these metabolic abnormalities.\\nThe differential diagnosis of coma in diabetics includes non-ketotic hyperglycaemic coma, \\nparticularly in elderly diabetics; lactic acidosis, especially in patients on metformin; pro -\\nfound hypoglycaemia; and non-metabolic causes for coma (e.g. cerebrovascular attacks and \\ndrug overdose). Salicylate poisoning may cause hyperglycaemia, hyperventilation and coma, \\nbut the metabolic picture is usually one of dominant respiratory alkalosis and mild meta -\\nbolic acidosis.\\nThe aims of management are to correct the massive fluid and electrolyte losses, hypergly -\\ncaemia and metabolic acidosis. Rapid fluid replacement with intravenous normal saline and \\npotassium supplements should be started. In patients with cardiac or renal disease, a central \\nvenous pressure (CVP) line is needed to control fluid balance. Regular monitoring of plasma \\npotassium is essential, as it may fall very rapidly as glucose enters cells. Insulin therapy is \\ngiven by intravenous infusion adjusted according to blood glucose levels. A nasogastric tube \\nis used to prevent aspiration of gastric contents, and a bladder catheter is needed to measure \\nurine production. Antibiotics and local wound care should be given to treat this man’s foot \\nulcer. In the longer term it is important that this patient and his wife are educated about \\nhis diabetes, and that he has regular access to diabetes services. His smoking and alcohol \\nconsumption will also need to be addressed. There may be social issues to be considered in \\nrelation to his unemployment.\\nKey Points\\n•\\tDehydration, tachypnoea and ketosis are the key clinical signs of diabetic ketoacidosis.\\n•\\tTwenty per cent of the population (and therefore doctors) cannot smell ketones.'),\n",

Theophylline may sometimes be useful as a third-line therapy but \\nhas more side effects.\\nWith this degree of severity, inhaled corticosteroids and long-acting bronchodilators (sal -\\nmeterol/formoterol or tiotropium) would be appropriate inhaled therapy. Careful attention \\nwould need to be given to inhaler technique.\\nHe is cyanosed and has signs of right-sided heart failure (cor pulmonale).

Annual influenza vaccination should be recom -\\nmended, and Streptococcus pneumoniae  vaccination should be given. Antibiotics might be \\nkept at home for infective exacerbations.\\nExercise tolerance will be reduced by his obesity and by lack of muscle use. A weight-\\nreducing diet should be started.

This \\nwould also fit with the haematological picture showing normocytic anaemia, raised neutro -\\nphil count and a high ESR. In the elderly, infective endocarditis may be an insidious illness \\nand should be considered in any patient who has murmurs and fever or any other change \\nin the cardiac signs or symptoms. The other classical findings of splenomegaly, splinter \\nhaemorrhages, clubbing, Osler’s nodes, Janeway lesions and Roth’s spots are usually absent. \\nPrecipitating events such as dental treatment or other sources of bacteraemia may not be \\nevident in the history.\\nIt is difficult to tie all the features into any other single diagnosis. The signs are of aortic valve \\ndisease. When there is a fever or other evidence of infection in the presence of valve disease, \\ninfective endocarditis must always be considered, although in practice other unrelated infec -\\ntions are more common. Other infections, such as tuberculosis or abscess, are possible, or \\nthere could be an underlying lymphoma or other malignancy.\\nThe most important investigations would be the following:\\n•\\t blood cultures performed before any antibiotics are given. In this case three blood \\ncultures grew Streptococcus viridans.\\n•\\t echocardiogram, which showed a thickened bicuspid aortic valve, a common con-\\ngenital abnormality predisposing to significant functional valve disturbance in \\nmiddle and old age. Vegetations can be detected on a transthoracic echocardio -\\ngram if they are prominent; at transoesophageal echocardiogram is more sensi -\\ntive in detecting vegetations on the valves but more demanding for the patient and \\nthe operator.\\nTreatment with intravenous benzylpenicillin and gentamicin for 2 weeks, followed by oral \\namoxicillin resulted in resolution of the fever with no haemodynamic deterioration or \\nchange in the murmurs of mixed aortic valve disease. A microbiologist should be consulted \\nabout appropriate antibiotics and duration.\\nAfter treatment of the endocarditis, the symptoms of pain and tiredness on exertion would \\nneed to be considered to see if valve surgery was indicated. Prior to this it would be routine to \\nlook at the coronary arteries by angiography to see if simultaneous coronary artery surgery \\nwas needed in a patient of this age.\\nKey Points\\n•\\tSymptoms on exertion in aortic valve disease are a sign that valve surgery needs \\nto be considered.\\n•\\tIn infective endocarditis, it is unusual to have many of the classical physical signs. \\nIn the elderly, it may present with non-specific malaise.'),\n",

The patient \\nis likely to become very ill without markedly abnormal physical signs. Atrial fibrillation \\nincreases the likelihood of such an event. She has been on aspirin, which will reduce slightly \\nthe risk of embolic events, but is not on anticoagulants, which would have decreased the risk \\nfurther. In the presence of pre-existing cardiovascular problems, shown by the hypertension \\nand angina, anticoagulation would normally be started if there are no contraindications. \\nThe risk of cerebrovascular accidents caused by emboli from the heart has been shown to be \\nreduced. In lone atrial fibrillation with no underlying cardiac disease, the risks of emboli and \\nthe benefits of anticoagulation are less. There are alternative diagnoses, such as perforation \\nor pancreatitis, and it is not possible to be sure of the cause of the abdominal problem from \\nthe information given here.\\nThe chart of the observations (Figure\\xa0 94.1) covers 10\\n h. A\\nfter the first hour or two the central \\nvenous pressure drops, the blood pressure falls, and the pulse rate rises in association with \\nthe fall in urine output.\\nThese findings show that she is developing shock with inadequate perfusion of vital organs.\\n!

The fact that the cardiac output is high makes blood loss and \\ncardiogenic shock unlikely. The most likely cause is septic shock, for which peripheral \\nvasodilation would lead to a high cardiac output but a falling blood pressure and rising \\npulse rate. Vasoconstriction and reduced blood flow occur in certain organs, such as the \\nkidneys, leading to the term distributive shock with maintained overall cardiac output but \\ninappropriate distribution of blood flow. The rise in central temperature and the lack of a \\nmarked fall in peripheral temperature would fit with this cause of the shock.\\nThe patient was stabilized with fluid replacement and antibiotics before going to theatre, \\nwhere the diagnosis of ischaemic bowel from an embolus was confirmed. Arteriography can \\nconfirm the diagnosis, but confirmation is often at laparotomy, which is usually required to \\nremove the necrotic bowel.\\nKey Points\\n•\\tAspirin and anticoagulation should be considered in patients with atrial fibrillation.\\n•\\tSeptic shock may be present with warm peripheries through vasodilation.\\n•\\tA drop in the central venous pressure may be the first sign of developing shock.'),\n",

This woman has Parkinson’s disease \\npresenting with the classic triad of tremor, rigidity and hypokinesia. Tremor is usually an \\nearly symptom and may be unilateral. The combination of tremor with rigidity leads to the \\ncogwheel form of rigidity. The patient often goes on to have a blank mask-like facies. There \\nis difficulty starting to walk (freezing), and the patient uses small steps and has difficulty \\nstopping (festination). There is generally normal intellectual function, but there is often \\ndepression. Sleep is often disturbed, contributing to daytime tiredness.

Benign essential tremor is not present at rest, but appears on holding \\nthe arms outstretched, but is not worse on movement (finger–nose testing). Tests \\nof coordination are normal, and walking is unaffected. There is usually a family his -\\ntory of tremor, and the tremor is helped by alcohol and beta-blockers.\\n•\\tIntention tremor: the tremor is worse on movement and is most obvious in finger–\\nnose testing. It is usually caused by brainstem or cerebellar disease caused by such \\ndiseases as multiple sclerosis, localized tumours or spinocerebellar degeneration.\\nA variety of drugs are available to treat this woman’s Parkinson’s disease. Selegiline, an \\ninhibitor of monoamine oxidase B, may delay the need to start levodopa and may slow the \\nrate of progression of the disease but has significant side effects. Levodopa is usually used in \\ncombination with a selective dopa decarboxylase inhibitor, which does not cross the blood–\\nbrain barrier and reduces peripheral adverse effects. The commonest side effects are nausea, \\nvomiting, dizziness, postural hypotension and neuropsychiatric problems. After many years \\nof treatment the effects tend to diminish, and the patient may develop rapid oscillations in \\ncontrol—the ‘on–off’ effect. When these develop, a sustained-release formulation of levodopa \\nor a dopamine agonist (e.g. bromocriptine) may produce improvement. Because of the loss of \\neffect with time, treatment should not be started too early. This requires careful discussion \\nwith the individual patient. She should be assessed by a physiotherapist and occupational \\ntherapist and provided with advice and aids. With time her house may need to be altered to \\naid her mobility.'),\n",

It is often difficult to be \\nsure of the exact length of history when a symptom such as breathlessness has an insidious \\nonset. A few possibilities are raised by the details of the history. There is a history of asthma, \\nbut the absence of wheezing or obstruction on the respiratory function tests rule that out \\nas the cause of the current problem. An occupational history is always important in lung \\ndisease but probably not here. Occupational asthma can be associated with isocyanates used \\nin the printing trade but this would cause an obstructive problem rather than the restrictive \\nproblem shown here. The findings on examination fit with a restrictive problem with limited \\nexpansion and crackles caused by reopening of airways closing during expiration because of \\nstiff lungs and low lung volumes.\\nThe respiratory function tests show a mild restrictive ventilatory defect with reduced FEV\\n1 \\nand FVC but a slightly high ratio, suggesting stiff lungs or chest wall. Further tests such as \\ntransfer factor would be expected to be reduced in the presence of pulmonary fibrosis.\\nThe chest X-ray shows small lung fields and nodular and reticular shadowing most marked \\nin mid- and lower zones. The high-resolution CT scan shows widespread fibrotic change with \\nsubpleural cyst formation. These changes are compatible with diffuse pulmonary fibrosis \\n(fibrosing alveolitis). In talking about fibrosis of the lungs, it is important to differentiate dif -\\nfuse fine pulmonary fibrosis, as in this case, and localized pulmonary fibrosis as a result of \\nscarring after an acute inflammatory condition, such as pneumonia. The distribution and the \\npattern of the changes on the CT scan are important in determining the diagnosis and the \\nlikelihood of response to treatment in pulmonary fibrosis. Diffuse pulmonary fibrosis can be \\nassociated with conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis and can be induced by inhaled dusts \\nor ingested drugs. None of these seem likely here, making this likely to be idiopathic pulmo -\\nnary fibrosis (IPF). There is a rare familial form, so the father’s illness might be relevant. The \\nmost common type of IPF is usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP) with a subpleural distribu -\\ntion on the CT scan as shown here. In association with connective tissue disease, there may \\nbe a more widespread patchy pattern of non-specific interstitial pneumonitis (NSIP). The \\nappearance of ‘ground-glass’ shadowing on the high-resolution CT is associated with active \\ncellular alveolitis and the greater likelihood of response to treatment. NSIP also has a better \\nresponse rate than UIP.\\nFurther investigations consist of a search for a cause or associated conditions and a decision \\nwhether a lung biopsy is warranted. Bronchoscopic biopsies are too small to be representa -\\ntive or useful in this situation, and a video-assisted thoracoscopic biopsy would be the usual \\nprocedure. It would usually be appropriate to obtain histology of the lung in someone of \\nthis age.\\nTreatment consists of low- to moderate-dose corticosteroids with or without an immuno -\\nsuppressant such as azathioprine continued for several months to look for an effect, but the \\nresults are poor in UIP, and it is important not to cause more harm than benefit from treat -\\nment with prolonged steroids and immunosuppressants. There is some evidence that anti -\\noxidants such as acetylcysteine improve the outlook, and these may be combined with the \\nsteroids and azathioprine and new agents are under investigation. In a patient of this age, \\nlung transplantation might be a consideration as the disease progresses. Progression rates are \\nvariable, and an acute aggressive form with death in 6 months can occur. More common in \\nUIP is steady progression over a few years.'),\n",

The heterozygous form affects about 1 in 400 individu -\\nals in the United Kingdom, and 50 per cent of males will develop ischaemic heart disease \\nbefore the age of 50 years. Corneal arcus, xanthelasmata and xanthomata on Achilles ten -\\ndons and the extensor tendons on the dorsum of the hands develop in early adult life. The \\nmetabolic defect is a result of a reduced number of high-affinity cell-surface LDL receptors. \\nThis leads to increased LDL levels. Increased uptake of LDL by macrophage scavenger recep -\\ntors leads to increased oxidized LDL, which is particularly atherogenic. Triglyceride and \\nVLDL levels are normal or mildly elevated. HDL levels are low. The other major causes of \\nhypercholesterolaemia are familial combined hyperlipidaemia and polygenic hypercholes -\\nterolaemia. Familial combined hyperlipidaemia differs from familial hypercholesterolaemia \\nin patients having raised triglycerides. Patients with polygenic hypercholesterolaemia have \\na similar lipid profile to familial hypercholesterolaemia but they do not develop xantho -\\nmata. Hypercholesterolaemia may commonly occur in hypothyroidism, diabetes mellitus, \\nnephrotic syndrome and hepatic cholestasis.\\nThis patient is at extremely high risk for further vascular events, especially occlusion of his \\ncoronary artery bypass grafts. His risk depends on the combination of his risk factors, and \\nall of these need attention. He should be advised to stop smoking, reduce his alcohol intake \\n(which is also affecting his liver, as judged from the raised gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase), \\ntake more exercise, and eat a strict low-cholesterol diet. Diet alone will not control this level \\nof cholesterol. He should have pharmacological treatment with a statin but may need com -\\nbined treatment for this level of hyperlipidaemia. His children should have their lipid profile \\nmeasured so that they can be treated to prevent premature coronary artery disease. There is \\nclear evidence from clinical trials that primary prevention of coronary artery disease can be \\nachieved by lowering serum cholesterol. The West of Scotland Coronary Prevention Study \\n(WOSCOPS) showed cholesterol lowering with pravastatin reduced both the number of coro-\\nnary events and coronary mortality in middle-aged men with a serum LDL level greater than \\n4\\n mm\\nol/L. In patients who have evidence of cardiovascular disease, secondary prevention is \\neven more important, aiming for a cholesterol level as low as possible. Statins are well toler -\\nated, although myositis is a rare but serious complication.\\nKey Points\\n•\\tThe commonest causes for hypercholesterolaemia are polygenic hypercholesterol -\\naemia, familial hypercholesterolaemia and familial combined hyperlipidaemia.\\n•\\tEffective drugs are now available to treat hypercholesterolaemia and should be \\nused aggressively to reduce coronary artery disease.\\n•\\tIn secondary prevention the aim is the lowest possible cholesterol level.'),\n",

In view of the chest \\nX-ray, the most likely diagnosis is inappropriate AVP secretion with a small-cell undifferenti-\\nated carcinoma of the lung. This can be confirmed by measurement of serum and urine osmo-\\nlarities to show serum dilution while the urine is concentrated. Levels of AVP can be measured.\\nIn this case, the osmolarities confirmed the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone \\nsecretion (SIADH); bronchial biopsies at fibre-optic bronchoscopy showed a small-cell undif-\\nferentiated carcinoma. Extension to the carina and computed tomography (CT) appearances \\nshowed it was not resectable. Fluid restriction to 750\\n mL daily produced an increase in serum \\nsodium to128 mmol/L with improvement in the confusion and weakness. If this fails to pro -\\nduce adequate results, demeclocycline can be used. This derivative of tetracycline antibiot -\\nics interferes with the action of ADH in the renal tubules.

Much the commonest cause of \\nthese symptoms would be asthma but there are a number of features which make this less \\nlikely in this patient.\\nLoss of voice is a prominent symptom. The history suggests little response to beta agonist \\ntreatment, and the lung function tests after recovery from the episode do not show airflow \\nobstruction or a significant response to bronchodilators. The airway narrowing in asthma \\nmay be intermittent showing no obstruction between attacks, in which case it may be nec -\\nessary to look for increased bronchial responsiveness to a challenge such as exercise or \\ninhaled methacholine.\\nDuring the acute episode in association with severe symptoms the oxygen saturation is, \\nsurprisingly, normal. Inability to speak in complete sentences is a characteristic of severe \\nasthma but the loss of voice here suggests that there may be a problem at vocal cord level and \\nthis would fit with the marked inspiratory and expiratory wheezing and the feeling of being \\nunable to take air into her lungs although asthmatics may complain of similar problems.\\nThese features suggest that the diagnosis of vocal cord dysfunction is more likely than asthma \\nin this woman. In this condition there is paradoxical motion of the vocal cords so that they \\nadduct on inspiration to produce inspiratory airflow obstruction at the level of the larynx. \\nEpisodes of breathlessness tend to be intermittent, unresponsive to conventional asthma \\ntreatment and associated with stridor.\\nThe most important diagnostic tests are direct viewing of the cords by an ear nose and throat \\nsurgeon and a flow volume loop. Inspection of the cords will show paradoxical motion and \\nadduction of the anterior cords with a posterior ‘glottis chink’ allowing limited airflow. A \\nflow volume loop will show a relatively normal expiratory phase but loss of flow or low flow \\nin the latter part of the inspiratory loop as the vocal cords adduct and produce obstruction \\n(Figure 99.1).

Her urinalysis \\nis negative, which excludes a glomerular disease. It is more likely that her renal failure is due \\nto either tubulointerstitial disease or disease affecting the renal vasculature such as acceler -\\nated phase hypertension. Potential causes of tubulointerstitial disease in this case are the \\nNSAIDs and the herbal medicines. Her hypertension is likely secondary to her tubulointer -\\nstitial disease, and is accelerating the progression of her renal failure.\\nNSAIDs cause acute kidney injury by two different mechanisms: haemodyamically medi -\\nated and acute interstitial nephritis. Haemodynamically mediated acute renal failure is due \\nto inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis. Prostaglandins cause prerenal vasodilatation which \\nis crucial to maintain renal perfusion in the setting of hypovolaemia, cirrhosis and heart \\nfailure. In this case there is no evidence that she Is dehydrated. NSAIDs also cause an acute \\ninterstitial nephritis. There may be an associated fever, rash, eosinophilia and eosinophi -\\nluria. Spontaneous recovery occurs within a few months after the NSAID is discontinued \\nalthough there may be permanent renal damage. A course of prednisolone is generally given \\nto accelerate renal recovery and lessen long-term scarring. NSAIDs can also induce minimal \\nchange disease and membranous nephropathy causing nephritic syndrome. In addition to \\nthese acute effects, it has been suggested that daily NSAID use for a prolonged period of time \\nmay be associated with an increased risk of chronic kidney disease, although the percentage \\nof patients is small relative to the number of NSAIDs that are bought over the counter.\\nTraditional Chinese medicine includes herbal therapy, acupuncture, massage and dietary \\ntherapy. There is potential for developing novel treatments for diseases such as asthma and \\nfood allergies with Chinese herbs. However, there is concern over the lack of standardization \\nand controlled clinical trials. Chinese herbal medicines containing aristolochic acid have \\nbeen implicated in a specific nephropathy characterised by extensive interstitial fibrosis with \\natrophy and loss of the tubules, with thickening of the walls of the interlobular and afferent \\narterioles. Blood pressure is generally normal or only modestly elevated. Patients presenting \\nwith a creatinine < 200 will generally stabilise their renal function after stopping the Chinese \\nmedications, but patients with worse kidney function will generally progress to end-stage \\nkidney failure.\\nIn this case it is important to find out if her renal failure is acute or long-standing. This can \\neasily be discovered if she has had previous measurements of her serum creatinine. Renal \\nultrasound is also helpful. If the ultrasound shows small echogenic kidneys her renal failure \\nis likely chronic. If her kidneys are normal in size, a renal biopsy is indicated to confirm the \\ndiagnosis and assess the extent of inflammation and scarring.\\nIn this case her renal failure is likely due to a NSAID-induced interstitial nephritis. She \\nshould be advised to stop her NSAIDs and Chinese herbal medicines, and never to restart \\nthese drugs. She should be given a short course of prednisolone to hasten renal recovery.\\nKey Points\\n•\\t A full drug history is vital in patients with unexplained renal failure.\\n•\\t NSAIDs are the commonest drug implicated in acute interstitial nephritis.\\n•\\t Aristolochic acid–containing Chinese herbal medicines cause a characteristic \\nnephropathy.'),\n",
